Is Your Hobby Really a Business?

_A reader sent in the following question to me recently in regards to selling
on eBay:_

"Earlier this year I started selling stuff on eBay, mainly to clean out my
attic. I ran out of attic stuff a while back, so I've started selling stuff
for some of my friends and relatives. So far I've made about $50,000 after
expenses and splitting the proceeds with the people who give me stuff to sell.
I don't really look at this as a business, but I'm being told that I have to
pay taxes on what I'm making. Is that right?"

Let me get this straight: You've made $50,000 in eight months and you're not
sure if you have a business? Are you kidding?

A lot of people are surprised to find out that their cherished hobbies have
somehow "morphed" into real businesses overnight without their knowledge. Your
good-faith belief that what you're doing is "only a hobby" doesn't count for
much, however, when it comes to the IRS and your state and local tax
authorities. Under current law, if you're making even as much as $1 doing
_anything_, the tax authorities don't care if it's a hobby or a business--they
want their money. They'll view you as being self-employed, you'll have to
report your earnings as income, and you'll have to pay taxes on that income.

"Gross income," as the IRS defines it, includes income "from whatever source
derived." Let's say you're a coin collector. You sold two coins on eBay last
year just to get them out of your collection, and you made $100 profit doing
so. You should report the $100 as income on your tax return this year.

The "business vs. hobby" distinction truly comes into play when you _lose_
money. So, in my example above, if you lost $100 when you sold the two coins
on eBay, the IRS wouldn't let you deduct the $100 against your income from
other sources, such as your day job. You can only deduct "hobby losses"
against gains from the same hobby. So if this year you sell five coins on
eBay, making a $200 profit on two of the coins and a $200 loss on the other
three, you can "net" the loss against the profit and report zero income from
your hobby.

A professional coin dealer doesn't have to worry about this because he or she
is clearly engaged in a business. How do you tell the difference, especially
when the business involves buying and selling stuff, something that many
people do as a hobby--such as selling coins or antiques on eBay; breeding
cats, dogs or other animals; making arts and crafts for sale at craft shows;
publishing a newsletter; participating in various kinds of home party sales
where your main objective is to get discounts on the products; and other
activities where your primary objective is personal satisfaction rather than
economic gain.

Under a long-standing IRS rule, you're considered a "business" if you made a
profit in three of the past five years, including the current year. But what
if you are just starting out and are likely to lose money this year?

Don't lose hope. You may still be considered a "business" for tax purposes if
you can prove to the IRS that you're taking your activities seriously and are
treating them as a business with the primary goal of making a profit . . .
eventually.

So what sorts of things do you need to do? At a minimum, you should have a
name for your business, some stationery, invoices, a separate bank account,
separate books and records, a place in your home that's used only for this
business activity, and some records to show that you're spending some time
working on this activity on a regular basis. For example, if you're a coin
collector turned coin dealer, you should keep thorough accounts and records,
advertise in hobby publications, attend coin shows regularly in your area, and
consider forming a corporation or limited liability company to run the
business.

You should also consider preparing a formal business plan showing your
projected income and expenses over a five- or ten-year period--with some
profit at the end of that period. It would also help if you could show that
you're actively studying and learning how to be financially successful in your
business. Attending seminars, subscribing to trade magazines or newsletters,
buying (and reading) books about the business and consulting with various
professionals will also help.

You really need to talk to an accountant right away to determine your total
tax liability, but based on your e-mail, I'm pretty sure that:

  1. You'll have to pay federal, state and local income taxes on the full $50,000 in earnings from your business on eBay;
  2. You'll have to pay self-employment taxes (roughly 15.3 percent) on everything you've earned from eBay sales over $400;
  3. You'll have to pay these income and self-employment taxes in quarterly, estimated installments on April 15, June 15, September 15 and January 15 of each year; and
  4. If you've received more than $600 in fees from any one of your friends or relatives this year, he or she may have to send you a Form 1099 next January.

But that's not all. It sounds as if you're taking consignments of stuff to
sell on eBay. A growing number of states (mostly in the Midwest) are requiring
eBay consignment sellers to obtain auctioneer licenses. If you live in one of
these states, you'll have to pay a fee ranging from $200 to $500 and will also
have to take an evening course in "auction practices" at your local community
college before you can get the license.

Since it sounds like you've started a business, whether you knew it or not,
and will have to pay taxes on your income, whether you like it or not, why not
go the extra mile and set it up as a legal retail business? That way you can
deduct your business expenses (most of them anyway), as well as certain of
your household expenses if you claim the home office deduction. The steps
involved are quite simple for a business like yours:

  1. You'll have to obtain a federal Tax Identification Number (or Employer Identification Number) from the IRS. Go to [www.irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov/)and download Form SS-4, the application for a tax ID number.
  2. You'll have to register for your state's sales, use and other business taxes--your accountant can help you with the necessary paperwork.
  3. If you have a cute name for your business, you'll probably have to file a "trade name certificate" with your county or town clerk's office.
  4. You'll have to file Schedule C form ("income or loss from a trade or business") with your Form 1040 each year.

Welcome to the wonderful world of self-employment! You've already passed the
most difficult hurdle any new business faces--you're actually making money!
The only businesses that are tax-free--other than charities--are businesses
that don't make money. So set yourself up right, keep up the good work, and
may you always regard your business as a "hobby" that's both fun and
profitable.
