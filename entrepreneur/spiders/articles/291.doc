Hold On to What's Yours

John Lie-Nielsen, 28, is on the fast track. The San Francisco-area company he
and a partner started in 1999, Allied Cash Advance, is growing right out of
its britches. Happily, when it came time to buy bigger britches, Lie-Nielsen
knew right where he could find the deep pockets he needed.

Lie-Nielsen has been luckier than most--he's nailed down three rounds of angel
capital that helped him open the first retail locations for his short-term
consumer-loan business. In three years, the company has grown to more than 35
stores while doubling revenues each year. But the business is consumer-driven,
and Allied Cash Advance growth is fueled predominantly by opening new
locations.

With its angel capital spent, the company needed to secure more long-term
financing if it wanted to continue its rapid rollout. As the economy slowed in
early 2002, however, angels and VCs were growing reluctant to write checks--
and Lie-Nielsen was equally reluctant to sell stock at valuations that might
not reflect the company's significant prospects for growth.

The answer? Subordinated debt. Sometimes called mezzanine financing, or just
sub debt, a subordinated loan is unsecured (not backed by collateral), and
therefore the claims of the lender in such a loan are second in line--
subordinate--to claims from banks and other secured (asset-based) lenders.

**Do the Math**

"Of course, subordinated debt carries a higher interest rate than a bank loan
or other asset-based loan," explains Barry Morganstern, a managing director at
the Los Angeles-based corporate finance advisory firm Glick Morganstern
Capital Group. "Typically, the rate is between 10 percent and 14 percent for a
five-year note."

It may seem like subordinated lenders are asking a high price, but Lie-
Nielsen, who previously worked as an investment banker, quickly points out:
"Fourteen percent interest is much cheaper in the long run than the dilution
or loss of control that would come from another round of pure equity
investment. Our current shareholders could lose share value through dilution
if we took in another investor in these turbulent market times."

To evaluate different finance options you have to be able to figure out the
true cost of capital, often a tricky calculation. There is no rule of thumb
that works in all situations. It's important to remember, however, that
selling stock can work against you if the cost (in terms of share of the
company) is greater than the growth you'll realize by investing that money.

**Cash, Not Collateral**

The key to subordinated debt financing is cash flow. Sub debt is not secured
by collateral like the typical loan you might get from a bank. Much like a
credit card company, a subordinated debt lender is willing to take on the
extra risk of an unsecured loan in exchange for a higher return on its money.
"Most sub debt lenders are looking for a total of 25 percent to 30 percent
internal rate of return," explains Morganstern.

The difference between the 14 percent interest you pay and the 25 percent
return that sub debt lenders hope to realize is made up with stock warrants.
Warrants give the holder the right to purchase shares of stock in your company
at a pre-determined price. Essentially, owners of company stock warrants hold
some of the value of your company without actually becoming shareholders.

CapitalSouth Partners, a sub debt lender in the Southeast, regularly lends
companies from $2 million to $10 million for growth and restructuring. Their
typical borrower has greater than $10 million in revenue and between $1
million and $10 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization). Joe Alala, president and CEO of CapitalSouth
Partners, says the company charges between 12 and 14 percent for the loan, and
receives "warrant coverage" equal to 10 to 20 percent of the company's
outstanding stock. (Alala warns, however, that for companies with less than $1
million in EBITDA, warrant coverage can be much more expensive.)

In some cases, the lender will convert those warrants into marketable stock--
and cash--if the company is sold or goes public. Because few companies ever go
public, however, CapitalSouth and other sub debt lenders regularly sign a "put
option" with the company. This put option gives the lender the right to sell
the warrants back to the company at a future value. The sell-back price is
based on company valuation, which can be set as a multiple of earnings or by a
third-party appraisal.

**One to Grow On**

Subordinated debt is considered a long-term liability, and therefore should be
used for long-term projects. Sub debt can be used to finance a variety of
intangible growth-related expenses, including marketing, IT projects, product
development, R&D or, as in the case of Allied Cash Advance, lease and build-
out expenses for new store locations. Subordinated debt is not generally
intended to cover short-term needs like payroll or inventory.

"Half the borrowers use the money for growth, and half are going through
either an ownership change or restructuring," Alala estimates. Sub debt is
often ideal for purchasing a company or for rolling two companies together.
Because cash is often tight in these situations, CapitalSouth commonly
structures loans with interest-only payments.

**Where to Find It**

Despite--or perhaps due to--the decline in venture capital investing lately,
there are a growing number of financiers making subordinated loans. As with
most financial instruments, you can find a lender through finance
intermediaries--usually called corporate finance advisors, like Glick
Morganstern--or forge the relationships yourself.

If you enlist an advisor or broker to help you work a deal, you can be pretty
sure they'll give you a clear understanding of your options for both secured
(traditional) and subordinated debt instruments. Advisors can also assist you
in putting together a detailed presentation for your deal and shop it around
directly to the decision-makers at several sub debt lenders.

On the other hand, sub debt lenders are becoming more numerous and easier to
find. Many banks and credit unions have associations with sub debt lenders. As
Alala of CapitalSouth Partners puts it, "Although it helps to be introduced by
someone I know, anyone can call me or send me a note from our Web page." Alala
estimates that he sees around 15 sub debt deals a week, only a small fraction
of which come through his network of agents and acquaintances.

**Putting It to Use**

Back at Allied Cash Advance, John Lie-Nielsen has perfectly matched his growth
plans to the funding sources. The company received a line of working capital
from a traditional lender that finances accounts receivable. Then a regional
sub debt lender stepped in to help with the money needed to open new
storefronts.

The stockholders in Allied Cash Advance couldn't be happier: The subordinated
debt lender has provided enough capital to maintain strong growth for several
more years and has taken only a small piece of the equity to do it. The income
from new storefronts more than pays debt service on the loan, and the existing
shareholders were not penalized in the process.

**What's What**  
---  
A good corporate finance advisor can help you evaluate various funding
sources. Choosing secured debt, subordinated debt or equity capital depends on
your willingness to give up ownership, the cost of the capital and how you
plan to use the money.

  * **Secured debt** works if you have significant accounts receivable or inventory that you can put up as collateral. The cost of the loan is simply the interest rate, which may be only a few points above the prime rate--usually 6 to 8 percent. If your business can support it, this is almost always a good source of working capital, but is not well-suited for investing in long-term growth.
  * **Subordinated debt** is paid back solely from cash flow. The cost is the interest rate plus the equity you'll give up in the form of warrants. The interest rate can be from 10 to 14 percent, and the warrants may be for as much as 20 percent of your company. Because the loan is not backed by collateral, it's a good source of growth funds.
  * **Equity financing** is simply selling stock. Although there is no interest rate, the cost of capital can be significant. Weigh carefully both the dilution your existing investors will experience and the potential for loss of control of the company. Equity capital can be used for whatever your business needs, but keep in mind that you will only make all your stockholders happy by putting the money to its highest purpose--strong growth! -D.W.
