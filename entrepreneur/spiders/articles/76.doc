Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Sue YouTube Co-Founder Over Leaked Video

Oft-exposed Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have slapped YouTube co-founder Chad
Hurley with a lawsuit for exposing a bit more of their private lives than they
wanted.

West and Kardashian -- who, one recalls, had her own career launched because
of her, um, performance on an amateur video -- are suing Hurley for allegedly
leaking a video of their marriage proposal online through his new video-app
project called [MixBit.](https://mixbit.com/)

The duo claim techie Hurley wasn't even invited to the Oct. 21 event, though
in attendance were Alison Pincus, owner of shopping website One Kings Lane
and wife of Mark Pincus, in addition to Rap Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam
and VC Ben Horowitz. But Hurley gained access after signing a non-disclosure
agreement forbidding him from posting videos or images of the extravaganza.
The court filing even shows a picture of Hurley holding up the signed
agreement.

Apparently, Hurley took his chances.

The two-and-a-half-minute video titled "PLEEESE MARRY MEEE!!! Congrats Kim and
Kanye!" shows West proposing to his baby momma at AT&T Park in San Francisco,
as a 50-piece orchestra plays Lana Del Rey's "Young and Beautiful." (It was

del-rey-to-perform-at-proposal-to-kim-kardashian-but-she-said-no/) Del Ray
flat our rejected West's request to perform at that event).  Hurley tweeted
out the clip to his more than 500,000 followers, which has managed to rack up
more than 1.6 million views.

Kimye's lawyer claims Hurley did this out of desperation, to save Mixbit.

"Following a lackluster launch and unsuccessful ensuing debut, Hurley sought
to salvage MixBit from its dour beginning," the [lawsuit
](http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/showbiz/kardashian-engagement-video-
lawsuit/)states.

"An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21,
2013, event featuring West and Kardashian," it continues.

It seems unlikely that the lawsuit stemmed from privacy concerns but rather
they, not Hurley, wanted to cash in on the event, as _The Keeping Up with the
Kardashians_ crew was there filming every precious moment.

Kardashian and West are seeking unspecified damages.
