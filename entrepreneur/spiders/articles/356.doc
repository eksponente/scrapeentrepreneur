Ready For Takeoff

When John Spomar III signed a lease for the photo studio of his dreams,
located in a Chicago business incubator, the commercial photographer wasn't
exactly sure what to expect.

"All I knew was, I was tired of working from my parents' house and telling
clients that they couldn't come to my `studio,' because we would have been
meeting in my bedroom," says Spomar. "I needed some respectability, and the
price was right."

After signing the lease the day before his 24th birthday, Spomar could now
access a studio to die for. The 1,600-square-foot office even included a real
darkroom--a definite step up from developing pictures in his parents' laundry
room.

That was five years ago. Today Spomar, 29, is three months shy of graduating
from the Chicago Southland Enterprise Center. With incubator experience in his
arsenal, he feels well-equipped to leave the nest--and find success in the
commercial photography business.

"Thanks to the incubator, I've been able to completely devote the past five
years to building my business, and it's really paid off," says Spomar, whose
company, John Spomar Productions Inc., is making a name for itself in the
Chicago area. "I've increased my sales by 20 percent each year. Without the
incubator, I wouldn't have come this far."

Spomar is part of a growing number of young entrepreneurs taking advantage of
the incubators sprouting up all over the country. In many ways, such
establishments are similar to their namesake. Within a protected, safe
environment, start-up entrepreneurs get a cost-effective place to nurse their
fledgling businesses until they're mature enough to take flight on their own.

While incubating their businesses, tenants have access to a number of
benefits, including such services as secretarial and receptionist help,
business and technical expertise, and assistance seeking financing. They also
enjoy perks not available to bigger businesses, including office space at
below-market rates, flexible lease agreements and opportunities to network
with a variety of start-up entrepreneurs.
