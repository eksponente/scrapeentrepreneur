How to Make Your Cash and the Investor's Patience Last Until You're Profitable

Cashflow is a basic survival metric for every startup. Investors check your
_burn rate_ to assess your efficiency, and project your remaining _runway_
before you run out of money and into a brick wall. Don’t wait until you are
almost out of cash before managing every dollar spent, or looking for the next
refueling from investors. Desperate entrepreneurs lose their leverage and die
young.

It doesn’t take a financial genius to recognize that you need to keep your
burn rate low. Yet it always amazes me that I can find two different startups,
seemingly working on the same problem, with one having a burn rate several
times higher than the other. Of course, their answer is that the second
intends to get to market faster, but every engine has limits regardless the
fuel applied.

If your runway is less than a year, it’s time to either begin looking for a
new cash infusion or defining and implementing a Plan B to assure survival.
Your goal is that magical break even point and hockey-stick profit-growth
curve. Raising money from professional investors, even friends and family,
takes time. Count on six months from beginning the funding process until a new
check is cashed.

As a mentor to many entrepreneurs and startups, here are my best
recommendations for keeping the burn rate low, planning ahead and maintaining
credibility with investors:

**1\. Manage cashflow personally every day.**  A big influx of orders may feel like success, but can kill your business if you don’t have the cash to produce, deliver and wait for payment. The best entrepreneurs manage cashflow ruthlessly and never delegate decisions about spending money. Cashflow out equates to burn rate, and the runway depends on your reserves.

**2\. Buffer your projected resource requirements.** You will make mistakes. Things will cost more than you expect. Always add 20 percent to your best estimate of funding requirements when approaching investors. They understand startup realities. Better to ask for more early. Going back to investors for more money ahead of the plan is high in terms of credibility and leverage.

**3\. Use future cash for payments where possible.** Deferred payments start with stretching the payables period but, more importantly, include giving employee equity in lieu of a higher salaries and negotiating vendor deferred payments out of future revenues. Think of these alternatives as paying interest on a loan, and manage them wisely.

**4\. Be a miser with contract services and facilities.** One of the main reasons that former corporate executives often fail as startup CEOs is that they expect a big office and an entourage of expensive professionals to do the real work. Cashflow can be drastically reduced by working out of your garage. Tackling most of the support tasks yourself.

**5\. Use social media for early marketing.**  Hire a professional marketing and public relations agency once you have a good revenue stream but you don’t need them to start a free blog, establish Facebook and Twitter accounts with initial content and complete the basics of search engine optimization. Social media is not rocket science.

The timing of cashflow is everything. Waiting until you have something to sell
before bringing on a sales and operations staff. Getting a sales contract
before manufacturing inventory. Match your office, facilities and computer
equipment to the size of the staff you have today, and intend to have in the
next six months.

As a rule of thumb, your monthly burn rate should be less than 10 percent of
your last funding raise or starting cash in the bank. For example, a software
development startup raising $250,000 from angel investors better be able to
operate on $25,000 per month. This could equate to two technical founders
(with a minimal salary), funding two developers for a year.

In this case, the primary cash outflow would be for product development and
operating expenses, with potentially enough runway to build the initial
product, get a patent, attract some early adopters, and build the initial
revenue stream. That should equate to an adequate valuation for a $2 million
follow-on _Series-A_ round, without giving away all the equity.

Overall, managing cashflow and burn rate is more critical to your business
success than having the right idea and the right product.  It’s why most
investors proclaim that they invest in people, more than the idea. If you
adequately manage your burn rate, your startup is much less vulnerable to
flaming out before you get to that elusive break-even point.
