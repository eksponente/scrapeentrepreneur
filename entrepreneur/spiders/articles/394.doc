Tax Planning Primer for the Self-Employed

The IRS's Definition of Self-Employment  
According to the IRS, you're self-employed if you carry on a trade or business
as a sole proprietor, an independent contractor, a member of a partnership or
if you're otherwise in business for yourself. You can be a full-time employee
and still have self-employment income from a side job. To determine whether a
particular income is self-employment income (rather than employee wages, for
example), look at the source of your income and the extent of your involvement
in the activity. If you're self-employed, understand the self-employment tax
and be aware of the tax planning opportunities.

Tax Consequences of Self-Employment  
You must pay self-employment tax if you have self-employment income. If you
file a Schedule C as a sole proprietor, independent contractor or statutory
non-employee, the income listed on your Schedule C is self-employment income
and must be included on Schedule SE, which is filed with your Form 1040.
Schedule SE is used both to calculate self-employment tax and to report the
amount of tax owed. Self-employment tax is used by the federal government to
fund Social Security and Medicare benefits.

The self-employment tax rate on net earnings is 15.3 percent (with 12.4
percent of this rate going to Social Security and 2.9 percent allotted to
Medicare). All net earnings from self-employment in excess of $400 are subject
to the Medicare portion of the self-employment tax. However, the Social
Security portion of the self-employment tax applies only to net earnings from
self-employment in excess of $400, up to and including $102,000 in 2008
($97,500 in 2007). (The maximum is reduced if you have income from sources
other than self-employment that has been subject to Social Security tax.)

Employees generally have income tax, Social Security tax and Medicare tax
withheld from their paychecks. If you're self-employed, it's likely that no
one is withholding federal and state taxes from your paychecks, so make
estimated tax payments to cover your federal income and self-employment tax
liability. This will help you avoid liability for penalties, interest and
substantial tax bills at the end of the year.

Planning Opportunities  
As a self-employed individual, you have a number of income tax planning
opportunities. Here are some you may wish to consider:

1\. Shifting and Timing Income  
Shifting income to family members can be an important tax planning technique.
If you run your own business, your ability to shift income to a family member
who is in a lower marginal tax bracket can be a significant advantage. Your
relative may benefit from the increased income and you may benefit by the
decreased tax liability. It's also possible that the overall amount of federal
income taxes paid by the two of you would be lower. But be aware that the IRS
could question an unreasonable amount of compensation paid to a family member,
considering the services actually provided by the family member.

As a self-employed taxpayer, you also have greater control and flexibility on
timing the receipt of your income. This means that you have more control when
you pay tax on the income.

2\. Planning Retirement  
Establishing a retirement plan is another tax planning advantage for the self-
employed. If you're self-employed and have no employees, a qualified
retirement plan (such as a Keogh) may allow you to place pre-tax dollars into
a retirement account to grow tax deferred until withdrawal. If you have
employees, your business may have to provide coverage for them as well. The
type of retirement plan that your business should establish depends on your
specific circumstances.

3\. Reviewing Employee Benefit Plans  
Aside from retirement plans, there are other employee benefit plans--such as
cafeteria plans and medical benefit plans. You may wish to have your business
establish one or more such plans. Employee benefit plans play an important
role in attracting and retaining employees. Sole proprietors may also derive
certain limited benefits under these plans.

4\. Considering Business Expenses and Other Deductions  
Make sure your business is taking advantage of all of the deductions it's
entitled to, including deductions for certain startup costs. For instance, you
may be able to deduct a portion of the expenses for a business trip even when
the trip is combined with vacation. Other key deductions that you should
consider include the use of a home office, automobiles and business assets.

One major area of concern for many self-employed individuals is the high cost
of health insurance. Fortunately, some of your health-care related expenses
may be tax deductible. For instance, you may be eligible for the self-employed
health insurance deduction, which would enable you to deduct the cost of
health insurance that you provide for yourself, your spouse and your
dependents. This deduction is taken on the front of your federal Form 1040
(i.e., "above-the-line") when computing your adjusted gross income, so it's
available whether you itemize or not.

Contributions you make to a health savings account (HSA) are also deductible
"above-the-line." An HSA is a tax-exempt trust or custodial account you can
establish in conjunction with a high-deductible health plan to set aside tax-
free funds for health-care expenses.

Hobby Classification  
Sometimes it's unclear whether you're engaged in a trade, business or merely
deriving occasional income from a hobby. Although income generated from a
trade or business activity is taxable, losses from such an activity are
generally fully deductible. For this reason, taxpayers sometimes try to
classify a hobby as a trade or business. Consequently, the IRS closely
scrutinizes purported trade or business activities that regularly show losses.
If your business consistently shows a loss, be aware of the IRS's rules for
classifying activities as hobbies.
