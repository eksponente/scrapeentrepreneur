Investment Risks and Returns

**Q:** How do I establish the risk and expected return for investors in my business?

**A:** Several entrepreneurs have been asking about how risk and return relate to investment in their companies by outside capital providers. Thanks to 36 months of very poor performance in the stock markets, risk and expected return are once again very much on the minds of potential investors when they screen business opportunities. In order to put together a mutually agreeable funding deal for your growing firm, you need to understand how investors are thinking about risk and the prospects for returns on their investment.

The best place to start is to define risk. There's no such thing as absolute
risk, only relative risk. In other words, an investment can only be ranked as
more risky, less risky or about the same risk as a competing investment. For
entrepreneurs in today's very tight funding market, capital providers are
weighing competing alternatives when they look over your venture's investment
opportunity. Putting $100,000 into a start-up business is certainly more risky
than parking it in the money market or buying some shares in a bond mutual
fund, but the expected return on these alternatives will in most cases be much
lower than the upside of the new firm.

If investors compare buying stock in your company to buying stock in a
publicly traded firm, then you might be on better footing. The relative risk
of owning stock in your small manufacturing firm vs. being a stockholder in a
NASDAQ technology firm may be somewhat negotiable for most investors. As an
entrepreneur, your objective should be to present your venture in a very
professional manner, with a complete financial and product-marketing
disclosure and a business model that makes sense to investors. After all,
they'll be examining your forecasted position in the target market.

One way to deal with relative risk is to outline clearly the specific types of
risk being faced by your company. If there's a major technological hurdle to
overcome, be sure to describe this in detail and address the various
ramifications to the company at various levels of success in dealing with it.

Another strategy is to lay these risks side by side with other comparable
investments and their respective risks. For example, if your small
manufacturing enterprise is faced with the risk of having to break into a
fairly established product distribution network, present similar business
risks that come with competing investment opportunities. You could secure a
favorable review from investors if your risks are viewed as more easily
overcome given a certain strategy that you plan to employ. A $200,000
investment in a public company's stock might have comparable risks to your
distribution-network hurdle. The question for investors is typically focused
on how management will deal with the risk. The public company may not have as
strong a plan as your firm, and the likelihood of being successful could more
strongly favor your emerging start-up because you have a clearly articulated
plan in place that has a reasonable chance of working.

Remember, public companies are like your private firm in many ways. They face
competition, technology limitations, product differentiation, labor and
management concerns, various regulations and legal issues, cost concerns on
materials, and a wide variety of questions about the long-term financial
stability of the asset structure and cash flow. Many smaller start-up
companies could actually have an advantage over competing investments in
public stocks or mutual funds because the investors can meet face-to-face with
the entrepreneur and senior management team to discuss risks and appropriate
strategies for dealing with these. That option is often not available for
publicly traded securities.

Having dealt with the risks and relative concerns with competing investment
opportunities, the matter of return presents two specific issues to deal with.
On the one hand, expected return in two or three competing investments is a
very difficult metric to nail down. Investors typically gauge expected return
based upon a range of outcomes that could happen under different scenarios in
the company's operations. If too much optimism is factored into these possible
results, the expected return will be too high. If too much pessimism is used,
the expected return will be far too low. Again, the entrepreneur may be in a
better position than the public firm or mutual fund to compete for investors'
funds because of the proximity of the firm's owner-managers to the capital
providers. Face-to-face meetings, solid dialogues about probable sales and
profit outcomes and sharing ideas on how to manage and navigate the market and
its potential customer base are all solid advantages for many investors.

Given the current climate for truth in analysts' reporting and disclosure for
public companies, many angel investors are more likely to get behind an
investment in a firm where they can personally check things out and where they
have direct access to the senior management team. Rather than rely on some
stock report circulated throughout a nationwide brokerage, investors in
smaller, private firms often tend to have a better understanding of return
potential when compared to analyzing a public company.

Once the meaningful discussions have opened up with a potential investor, be
sure to directly address the issues of risk and return in a very specific
manner, drawing potential investors into the dialogue about the venture's
prospects. This kind of personal contact can often present your firm in a more
favorable light when compared to competing investments.
