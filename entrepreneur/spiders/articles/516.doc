60-Second Guide to Retaining the Records Your Business Needs

Paper, paper, paper. It's everywhere in a small business, from customer
invoices and expense receipts to your licenses and annual tax returns. Without
proper management, these records can gradually proliferate into a monumental
mess, making it difficult to find what you really need amid the clutter.

Don't get caught in the business records runaround. **_In just 60 seconds_**,
we'll give you some guidelines for culling that plethora of paper down to the
essentials.

**0:59 Know What You Need**  
Some things like copies of your business tax returns, licenses, incorporation
papers and capital equipment expenses should be preserved indefinitely. Keep
any tax-related documents (expense receipts, client 1099 forms, vehicle
mileage logs) for a minimum of seven years.

**0:48 Consolidate**  
Organize a your business records in a single, secure, easily accessible
location-a file cabinet or subdivided box. This will make the information more
easily retrievable, and help you track changes in your business over the
years. Also, maintain a summary list of your file contents, particularly if
you store little-used back-up information separately.

**0:37 Secure the Irreplaceables**  
Papers that are difficult or impossible to replace should be kept in either a
safe deposit box or a fireproof safe. Placing those documents in plastic
covers will help protect them, and-more importantly-prevent you from
accidentally giving away an original copy. Keep the key or combination in a
secure location. Tell two or three people (e.g., key employees, family
members) how to access this information in the event you are unavailable when
it is needed.

**0:26 Look Before You Scan**  
Scanners and PDF formats makes it easy to convert paper records to more
convenient digital media. Depending on the type of document, however, a
digitized version may not be acceptable for certain uses. It's also a good
idea to store your digital records on backup disks or CDs. Make a separate
backup copy of these records for storage in your safe deposit box or other
secure off-site location. Update all backup versions on a regular basis.

**0:15 Make Regular Reviews**  
Don't let your receipts and other business records pile up. You need only a
few moments once or twice a week to route your paperwork to the proper
location. Allowing these documents to accumulate for "later" only creates a
larger, more intimidating chore, as well as the temptation to simply stuff it
away in a box for "much later."

**0:04 Shred It!**  
When the time comes to purge records from your business, use a shredder to
ensure that no sensitive information falls into the wrong hands. Your local
office supply store likely offers many low-cost, compact shredders that will
easily attach to your office wastebasket. This simple investment will go a
long way in safeguarding you and your business from identity theft, and other
risks of misplaced documentation.
