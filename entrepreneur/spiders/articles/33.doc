5 Pieces of Bad Advice You Should Ignore If You Want Your App to Succeed

When you start to build an app, you may receive a plethora of advice from your
friends and network. While much of it can be great advice, some of it will be
so misleading that it could put you and your app dreams in jeopardy.

I have mentored a few hundred app entrepreneurs and it pains me to listen to
them talk about their experience living through some of the advice they
received over the years. I do not want you to go through similar challenges,
so I’m putting down a list of some of the worst advice that those
entrepreneurs received that put them off the course of building an app that
their users wanted.

## 1\. Patent your app

If I had to single out the worst advice, it would be this. As an entrepreneur
that is starting to build their company or product, your focus should be on
getting product/market fit and traction, rather than filing for a patent.

There are so many issues with this advice, but let’s focus on a couple of key
ones. Many people pursue patent protection because they fear their ideas will
be stolen. My response to that fear is that you can either build a company or
you can hold a patent, you have to make a choice.

Ideas don’t make for successful products. It is the execution that makes all
the difference. Google didn't have a different idea from the 23 other search
engines. It was the execution that differentiated it. So drop the fear of
someone else running with your idea.

Only look at patent protection if you’ve built something unique and if it is
successful. If your app doesn’t get traction, there’s no point in a patent.

Remember, getting a patent issued is an expensive proposition and could take
years.

## 2\. Best practices

Take in all the business and product advice you can but ultimately do what
your gut says. Do what your customers want. Best practices can take a hike.

If every successful app today emulated the best practices of the earlier
generation, we wouldn’t see much innovation, would we?

Your customers are unique, your app is different from idea to execution and
your situation and market may be different. How can you then adopt best
practices of other apps in the market where there are no similarities? Even if
some conditions are similar, why would you want to do the same thing?

## 3\. Market research

The traditional way of conducting market research for building a mobile
startup just doesn’t work. I don’t even know if it works in other industries,
but that’s a separate discussion.

If you ask your friends or focus groups whether they would identify with your
idea or product even before it is developed, you will be misled. People often
don’t know what they want. They know the problem they have, but it is up to
you to find the most efficient way to solve it for them. That’s the mark of a
great entrepreneur.

Often, that doesn’t come instantly. You do need customer feedback in terms of
whether your solution or execution resonates with them. The way to get market
feedback is through developing the first version of your app and observing the
behavior of your customers while they use it.

## 4. Build a business plan.

A startup often never goes according to plan. Chances are, even your first
version will not work with the customers and you may have to completely pivot
to stay in the game. How then will a business plan help?

Invest your energy into understanding what customers want and building an
efficient solution. What you need for your startup is a [business
model](http://leanstack.com). It will help bring a whole lot of clarity about
your product and your startup’s roadmap in the near term.

## 5\. Build for two platforms at once

While it’s tempting to reach out to every single potential customer on day
one, the reality is that it’s just not possible. If you’ve got a few million
people as your target audience, do you think you will be able to reach out to
them at the same time early on?

Marketing or distribution is the biggest challenge that you will face in your
startup’s journey. Build your app on one platform (either iOS or Android) and
go after the users that are present there. Once you’ve built something that
those people want, you can always replicate your success on the other
platform. Instagram was launched initially on iOS. The Android version came
two years later.

Building an app that no one wants on both platforms would just waste a lot of
time and money.
