Does Your Estate Plan Need a Disclaimer Provision?

Disclaimer provisions inside estate plans are growing in popularity these
days, and it's not difficult to see why. With the specifics of the federal
estate tax changing almost every year between now and 2011 (and a number of
states "decoupling" their own taxes from the federal system), it's never been
more difficult to get a fix on the death tax.

A disclaimer provision written into a will allows a surviving spouse-who could
inherit all the couple's assets tax-free, if he or she wanted-to give away, or
"disclaim," a portion of that estate within nine months of the first spouse's
death. This flexibility allows a couple to take advantage of the estate-tax
exemption for both spouses, if needed. For business owners with significant
assets, this is a key distinction.

There's nothing particularly new about the technique of putting some assets in
a trust and passing others to the spouse at death. For decades, estate
planners have used credit-shelter trusts, or bypass trusts, to do much the
same thing. But with the federal and state estate-tax exemption amounts now
shifting year by year, it's difficult for a credit-shelter trust to keep up
with the times. You either need to rewrite your estate plan annually, or you
need flexibility built into it.

Enter disclaimers. The idea is to give the surviving spouse a decision about
how much of an estate to keep and how much to put permanently beyond the reach
of the estate tax by putting it into a trust. It can make sense to place up to
the federal exemption amount ($1.5 million in 2004) into a trust so that those
assets avoid the estate tax. But the disclaimer provision also allows the
surviving spouse to make sure he or she has enough to live on before making
that call.

Fair warning: Disclaimer provisions are no panacea. For instance, the
surviving spouse has to be careful not to use any of the assets in the period
of time before he or she disclaims them in writing. The survivor also has to
make financial decisions during a very emotional time. It's possible he or she
might elect not to disclaim anything, for instance, undermining even the best-
laid estate plan.

Disclaimers are no more perfect than any other financial planning tool, in
other words. But as the death tax gets increasingly muddled over the next
seven or eight years, they will of necessity become more and more common.
