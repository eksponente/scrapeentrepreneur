Better Than a Bank?

About six years ago, [MedHelp Inc.](http://www.medhelpinc.com/)in Baltimore
needed new software to upgrade the billing and medical assistance
qualification services it provides to hospitals and physicians' practices. For
financing, MedHelp's software supplier suggested a local finance company with
which it had worked on other deals. Though MedHelp had a well-established
relationship with a bank, the company's partners felt certain their bank would
have misgivings about financing this particular asset. "I doubt very seriously
we could have gotten funding for the software from the bank because software
loses value so quickly," says Ian Johnson, MedHelp's vice president for
operations.

One big perk of not getting financing from a bank: Johnson and his partners
would not have to personally guarantee the loan. "Banks tend to want
everything to [secure] a loan," he says. "The bank would have wanted mortgages
and everything else."

Since that initial transaction, the $1.8 million company has turned repeatedly
to the finance company for funding, including recently when it needed a
$50,000 loan to buy discounted computer equipment from Dell. "Dell offered a
price for high-end servers that was good for only a couple of days," Johnson,
36, recalls. "We wound up saving $10,000 [on] the purchase of those servers
because [the finance company] was able to get the funding in place within 24
hours."

Small Firms Are Big Business  
MedHelp's financing habits are hardly unique. A recent study sponsored by the
SBA's Office of Advocacy found that finance companies are indeed big backers
of small businesses, ranking as the second-most important institutional
suppliers of credit to small firms. According to the SBA study, vehicle and
equipment loans and capital leases are especially popular finance company
offerings.

Their willingness to fund specialized equipment and offer longer lease terms
and flexible payment plans is a primary reason for their appeal. At the same
time, many small businesses have turned to finance companies because of
dissatisfaction with the banking industry--the megabanks in particular--
according to business growth strategist Andrew Sherman. "There isn't the
loyalty to large commercial banks that there used to be. [With] all the
mergers and acquisitions and the drop in customer service, many small
businesses feel ignored," observes Sherman, co-founder of Grow Fast Grow Right
Enterprises LLC, a Rockville, Maryland, training and education company for
rapid-growth and middle-market companies. "These commercial finance companies
have stepped in and tried to provide great customer service."

It's an opportune time for entrepreneurs to tap this growing capital source,
adds Sherman. "More and more of these finance companies have popped up over
the years," he says, "and that has made market conditions more competitive.
And when market conditions are more competitive, that usually favors the
borrower."

In addition to wooing small businesses with personal service and competitive
financing rates, many of these so-called "nonbanks" now offer streamlined
paperwork to ease access to financing. "The whole process just seems to go
faster," Sherman says. "And if it can go faster, that can make a big
difference for small-business owners."

MedHelp's lender, [Butler Capital](http://www.butlercapital.com/), can usually
give businesses a credit decision in one to three days for transactions up to
$500,000, while "a bank could [take] two to three weeks," says Joe Serio,
executive vice president and COO of the Hunt Valley, Maryland, financing firm.
"Because we understand the industries that we [lend to], we're considerably
faster than your typical bank."

Perhaps most important, finance companies on the whole are more willing to
finance "capital equipment, cars and other things that banks either won't
finance or won't finance as [readily]," Sherman says. "Typically, it takes
time for [banks] to cultivate relationships, and they would rather chase the
larger borrowers."

What's more, Serio notes, banks often get hung up on what they're lending
against: "The credit could be very strong, but they won't lend to that company
because it's [buying] software," he says. "[If] the underlying credit is
strong, what's the difference whether we would take back office furniture or
computer software? It's the ability of the customer to pay back the obligation
[that matters to us]."

Fewer Strings Attached  
Along with being more open to certain types of transactions, finance companies
are less likely to pressure borrowers for an additional piece of their credit
business. Banks, on the other hand, are more interested in cultivating a long-
term relationship with borrowers whose use of supplementary financial
products, such as investment services, makes the lending relationship more
profitable for the bank. Many banks even demand the business's deposits in
return for financing. "If [the business uses] a finance company that only
offers that one thing, there is less pressure to interrupt other relationships
that may be in place," says Sherman. "You can walk in and do a stand-alone
transaction without feeling pressured to do more."

Flexibility, of course, does have its costs. While commercial banks are one of
the cheapest sources of capital for entrepreneurs, typically charging just one
to two points above prime for small-business loans, financing companies charge
higher rates. "We're higher than a bank," acknowledges Serio, whose interest
rates can range from as low as 8 percent to more than 10 percent on larger
transactions. "But with a bank, it [takes longer] to get the deal done."

For Johnson, however, the higher financing costs are a small price to pay for
access to quick, convenient funding. "I have never looked at it from a
financial charge [standpoint]. Butler [Capital] has been willing to go the
extra mile to get it done, so we're more willing to pay a little bit more for
that type of service. It's another option that's out there."

In addition to the higher credit costs, bear in mind that while there are many
finance companies to choose from, not all are reputable. "Be really careful
regarding due diligence," Sherman warns. "Find out their track record. Find
out what they're going to be like if there's a default. Make sure you're not
[doing business] with a shifty character that's been reported to the Better
Business Bureau. Some of them are very, very good and have great reputations,
but some of them just got started yesterday and may be a little shadier in
their practices."

Serio concurs: "Whenever possible, you should talk to other clients that the
finance company has done business with."

Micro-Cap Mania  
Sometimes good things really do come in small packages. Take micro-cap stocks
--stocks with a market cap of between $50 million and $500 million--which went
up a whopping 72.3 percent over the past five years. It's easy to see why
they're gaining investor attention.

Until recently, interested investors had to settle for purchasing individual
micro-caps or a handful of mutual funds that play in the micro-cap arena.
These are risky and high-priced options, respectively. But no more: The past
six months have seen the launch of three exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that
make buying a basket of micro-caps both cheap and accessible. With expense
ratios of 0.6 percent (vs. 1.58 percent and up for mutual funds), the iShares
Russell Micro-cap Index fund, the PowerShares Zacks Micro Cap Portfolio, and
the First Trust Microcap ETF each track a micro-cap index and employ stock
screening to create a pool of 250 to 450 micro-caps.

Zacks Investment Management Inc., which licenses its micro-cap index to
Powershares Capital Management, sees these ETFs as a valuable diversification
tool for investors seeking a broad equity exposure. "Because there aren't as
many institutional investors buying these stocks, their price movements are
not as correlated with larger cap stocks," says Mitch Zacks, vice president
and portfolio manager. "So they reduce overall risk in your portfolio."

Investors who've bought micro-caps individually in the past should consider an
ETF, he adds. "When you buy into a $50 million market cap company that may
only trade 100,000 shares a week, your purchase can actually move the market.
[So] volatility can be huge, and liquid-ity can be an issue," explains Zacks.
"If you put that same money in a micro-cap ETF, you can easily get in and out.
Yet you're tracking the entire group, which should outperform the index over
time."
