Master These 4 Simple Pitching Concepts to Capture a Room's Attention

Being able to express your business idea in a clear, concise and coherent way
is how entrepreneurs attract investment, new partners and talent. Pitching a
new business to an audience, however, especially a large room full of
potential partners, can be incredibly intimidating. Moreover, trying to fit
everything you know and want to say about your idea in a short pitch, without
sounding like a [southern cattle

challenge.

It all comes down to delivery.

Last week, my fellow [Startup.SC](http://www.startup.sc) cohort entrepreneurs
and I delivered our first public business pitch to a standing room full of
business leaders, students and potential investors. After several weeks of
preparation and practice, the room was buzzing with excitement and
anticipation.

I was apprehensive about this first presentation. Startup.SC focuses on web-
based startup companies, but my new business idea, [Naked
Cask](http://www.facebook.com/nakcask), runs under a more traditional model
(with technology support). To overcome these expectations and sell the crowd
on my new idea, I focused less on the business and more on these simple
tactics.

## 1\. Demonstrate your passion.

I am a fairly passionate guy, especially when talking about something as
exciting as startups and business -- not to mention [craft

business idea. For me, demonstrating passion comes easy, but for others not so
much. As an observer, mentor and judge, I have seen numerous pitches fall flat
because the entrepreneur failed to deliver even an ounce of passion through
their pitch.

Being passionate does not require you to be as animated as [Robin
Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH7crqRvhhc) circa 1977. Simply
showing a little enthusiasm for your idea, and even dropping the simple line,
“I am passionate about this,” is all you really need.

## 2\. Tell the story.

Most pitches follow a format of problem, solution, plan. They are predictable
and tiresome. What I remember most about the best pitches I have heard are the
incredible personal stories involved with identifying the problem and finding
the solution. It is through personal narrative that an entrepreneur connects
to the audience, and it is through that connection, in that brief amount of
time, that they earn respect and confidence.

Of course, time is limited, so your story needs to be completely pertinent to
your idea. Do not waste this valuable time with stories that do not support
your idea or credibility.

## 3\. Focus on team and execution.

The greatest business ideas are worthless if not executed properly. For this
reason, your pitch needs to emphasize the value that you and your team add to
the project, and more important your ability to see the idea through to
fruition. Again, this involves weaving a pertinent and personal story into the
narrative while effectively and concisely demonstrating your team's experience
and background.

## 4\. Have a good idea.

Of course, a pitch is nothing without a worthy idea. I purposely put this
point last, however, as great entrepreneurs and pursuasive pitches can
convince an audience that even a small problem is worth solving. For the most
part, if investors are sold on you, your team and your passion and commitment
to see ideas through, they will find a way to get involved, regardless of the
idea.

There is no shortage of amazing [resources for pitching
investors](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/pitching-investors) available to
entrepreneurs. What I have found, however, is that whether you are pitching an
idea to single person or standing-room-only venue, consider yourself as an
entertainer performing a one man/woman monologue. Like every great monologue,
every word and every emphasis is strategically and effectively crafted to have
the highest impact on the story. Your pitch is no different.

Master these concepts and you will capture the room's attention, garner the
respect and confidence you deserve, and hopefully find the partners you need
to take your business to the next level.
