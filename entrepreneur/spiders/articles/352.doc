Doing Due Diligence

Several readers have expressed concern about not knowing what is meant by "due
diligence" as it relates to potential funding sources for their emerging
ventures. Here's how to think of it: It's actually a very simple concept with
many interpretations and multiple levels of implementation.

First, the definition should mean nothing more than an investor being
"diligent" when checking out the substance of the claims made by an
entrepreneur with respect to the market, the product or service concept, the
competition, the management team and so on. The term "due" means that it's
expected and someone has to perform this task. So the concept is really all
about the diligence that is due the investigation into an emerging company's
plan for doing business. There are some in the financing environment who
expect this to be done by the entrepreneur on behalf of the investors, and
that's a completely wrong understanding. The company founder makes some form
of disclosure within the business plan, but the responsibility to follow-up on
and check out the statements made in that document falls squarely on the
shoulders of the investor. For the scope of your financing experiences, always
assume that the potential funding source is the one that will check and
recheck everything presented by the entrepreneur.

The next issue to consider is how the due diligence gets accomplished. As I
said before, this varies considerably from deal to deal. At the first level, a
potential investor may pass the business plan along to a colleague who has
specific experience in the same (or a similar) area of the new venture.
Technical drawings, terminology, articles cited, machinery or processes
described, pricing and shipping practices, and marketing channels are all
examples of categories within the plan that need to be checked carefully by
investors to see if the entrepreneur really knows what he or she is talking
about. Certain industries may have very unique issues in these and other
company functions. A skilled eye with experience in that same market space
will be able to comment on the accuracy of the statements made. If your
general contracting business idea doesn't convey a clear understanding of the
specific issues related to building supplies, pricing, payment terms or
financial commitments on real estate, then due diligence should readily pick
up on these as red flags that bring into question the overall quality of the
deal.

Due diligence can also go several steps further. Investors will often pick up
the phone and contact people or companies named in your business plan. If Jill
Smith is listed on your advisory board with an impressive electrical
engineering background, investors will want to speak directly with her and
follow-up on where she went to school, how long has she been in the industry
and hear her version of what she's doing on the board. If Jones and Jones Inc.
is listed in the plan as the primary supplier of parts inventory to the new
venture, not only will investors want to talk with shipping and manufacturing
people at Jones and Jones, but they may also want to visit the factory to meet
the owners and production crew and see the operation firsthand. When an
accounting practice, law firm or design company is named in the plan, a
thorough due diligence speaks directly with each of these and discusses the
extent of the business relationship with the entrepreneur and the new company.

This also applies to statements about patents, trademarks, exclusive contracts
and deals currently in process with a large buyer. Investors would like to
mitigate as many risks as possible related to the funding opportunity. Due
diligence simply allows them to check and double-check the pertinent pieces of
the deal before deciding whether to provide capital. So don't get upset when
an exhaustive due diligence is performed on your business proposal. If
everything's accurate in your presentation, then the due diligence will
further validate that fact and investors will be more likely to put money into
your deal.
