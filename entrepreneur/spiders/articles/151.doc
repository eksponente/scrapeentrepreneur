The Importance of Culture When Starting Up

**Q: Most of the startup are only focused on one thing: survival. How important is culture to a startup? **  
_-Kenny Lee Chia Chern_  
  
**A:** I love what famed management consultant Peter Drucker has said, “culture eats strategy for breakfast.” 

Culture actually drives the value of the business.  Culture and the bottom
line are not, and should not, be at odds.  Having a stronger culture is not a
sacrifice to profits.  In fact, it’s quite the contrary: The companies that
are best thought to have strong, conscious cultures and represent the tenets
of "Conscious Capitalism" -- a model focused on advancing humanity, while
using established business principles -- are shown to outperform the [S&P 500

Relationships between your stakeholders – how they feel about each other – is
a huge part of how a company’s culture manifests itself…of how the company
“feels.”  And when you’ve developed strong, mutually beneficial relationships
with vendors, customers and employees from the start, all of these
stakeholders we'll conspire to assist you.  They want to see you win.  They
trust you and you trust them.  They’re even more vested in your success and
want to be a part of it.  These actions lead to a _stronger_ bottom line.

And laying the groundwork for a strong, unified, communication-driven,
supportive and fun culture at the start is much easier to do than, say,
turning the barge around in a river once the company has grown and expanded.
Not that over the years a company’s culture can’t and won’t evolve…it will and
it should.  But if it has grounding from the start, if it binds people
together, you’re setting the company up for greater success in the future.

Operating this way not only enriches your life and the lives of the people you
do business with, but if all you want to do is make as much money as humanly
possible then I would submit to you, that this is the way to do it.
