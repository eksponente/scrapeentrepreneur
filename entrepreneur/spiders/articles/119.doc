5 Common Pitfalls That Ruin Businesses -- and How to Avoid Them

If you’re trying to picture all the events and factors that can possibly ruin
a business -- stop. It would be virtually impossible to list out every
conceivable piece that could ultimately lead your company to a disaster, and
some of the most dangerous problems are [the ones you never see
coming](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238319).

That being said, many businesses do collapse as a result of common,
preventable issues -- and understanding those issues, before they do any real
damage, can put you in a position to prevent or mitigate them. Startups are
especially vulnerable, with limited resources and a weak, volatile structure,
but entrepreneurs can prevent disaster simply by taking measures to look for
these all-too-common pitfalls:

## 1. Insufficient capital

In order to function, businesses need money, and a good share of it. Startups
usually have trouble finding the resources to start -- either finding funding,
attaining credit or pooling personal financial resources to try and make ends
meet. More experienced companies usually suffer from insufficient capital when
their spending starts to outweigh their revenue.

Keep a handle on your capital situation by monitoring your cash flow. Closely
monitor your expenses, and [don’t be afraid to make cuts if you need
to](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237421). The earliest stages of your
company’s growth are the most vulnerable to insufficient capital, but that
doesn’t mean you’re out of the woods once you’ve been around a few years.
Watch your numbers closely.

## 2. Poor growth speed

Another key reason for business failure is an inappropriate growth rate. For
most entrepreneurs, that reads as “not growing fast enough,” but growing too
fast can be a problem too.

Not growing fast enough means you’ll be expending lots of money, but you won’t
have the customers or the revenue to exceed it. Growing too fast comes with a
different set of problems -- demand becomes too high, resources become
overworked or poorly trained, and your customers have inconsistent
experiences.

[Work closely with all your
departments](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237077), especially your
marketing team and human-resources department, to make sure your company
achieves a reasonable, steady pace of growth.

## 3. Competition woes

Never underestimate your competition. Competition can crush your business
totally if you aren’t careful, especially if you haven’t taken the time to
fully understand it. Startups based around a new idea sometimes get too sure
of themselves, neglecting to keep a watch on the markets -- competition isn’t
necessarily a bad thing, but you need to make sure you differentiate yourself
in a way that makes your company seem like the more appealing service.

Bigger companies also struggle with competition, but usually in the form of
more nimble startups. For example, giant tech firms often struggle to keep up
with the ingenious pace of new tech startups -- some find a solution in
acquiring the agile business, rather than trying to compete directly. There
are many strategies to deal with the competition, but you need at least one.

## 4. Internal strife

Internal strife can tear a company apart, especially during the early stages
of development. In many startups, entire departments are reliant on a small
group of workers, and if all those workers leave -- the department is, in
effect, crushed immediately. If there is a disagreement between department
heads over the direction of the company, [the entire enterprise could be
thrown in turmoil](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235760), and customers
could suffer as a result.

Even bigger, more tenured enterprises can fall apart due to internal strife --
just at a higher level. If the CEO and the board of directors cannot reach
agreements, or if partners cannot resolve a dispute, that tension trickles
down, and eventually, the whole company suffers the consequences.

## 5. Dependence

Too many companies fail because they were overly dependent on one thing. Maybe
that’s a highly valuable customer. Maybe it’s a very talented and experienced
worker. Maybe it’s just an environmental condition that allows for the company
to be successful.

Customers can opt out. Workers can quit. Environmental conditions can -- and
will -- change. If you allow any part of your business to be dependent on
anything, you’re setting yourself up for disaster (or at least a huge gamble).
Instead, hedge your bets by [investing in multiple variations and multiple,
complementary dependencies](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236537).

By no means are these five pitfalls intended to cover every possible disaster
that could befall your company. There are plenty of other dangers that could
weaken your brand or compromise your internal structure -- but these are some
of the most common and some of the most preventable.

As the leader of your company, [your sight needs to be focused on the distant
horizon](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236355), not on the small day-to-
day problems that almost always work themselves out naturally. Keep watch for
these encroaching hazards, and take immediate actions to thwart them before
they become irreversible.
