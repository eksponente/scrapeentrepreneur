The 5 Biggest Tax Differences Between an LLC and Corporation

Among the many decisions you need to make when launching a business is
selecting a business structure. If you do nothing, your business, by default,
is structured as either a general partnership (multiple owners) or sole
proprietorship (solo owner). These may be the simplest entities to form, but
they offer one major drawback: There’s no separation between the business and
business owner.

If your partnership or sole proprietorship business is sued or can’t pay its
bills, your personal assets can be on the hook. That is why both the Limited
Liability Company (LLC) and C corporation, or just corporation, are popular
business structures, as they minimize the owner’s personal liability. Yet,
they have vastly different approaches to taxation.

Here we’ll break down the five key differences between how an LLC and
corporation are taxed. While these pointers can be a great starting point, you
should consult a tax advisor if you have any questions about how these
differences apply to your particular situation.

## 1\. Pass-through business structure vs. non pass-through entity

By default, an LLC is considered a pass-through entity, similar to a sole
proprietorship or partnership. This means that the business itself doesn’t pay
income taxes on its profits; rather any profits or loss are passed through to
the owners (called members) and reported on their personal tax returns.

By contrast, a corporation is considered a separate legal entity and must
submit a tax return and pay income taxes on its profits. In some cases, this
can lead to “double taxation," where the corporation is taxed on its profits,
then when the owners take those profits out, they will need to report the
dividend on their personal tax returns. For some small-business owners who are
accustomed to taking profits out of the business, double taxation can be
costly.

Keep in mind that a corporation can elect a “S corporation tax treatment” to
be treated as a pass-through tax entity like an LLC. Additionally, an LLC can
even choose to be taxed like a corporation or an S corporation.

## **2\. Ability to leave money in the company**

While C corporations are subject to double taxation, they offer more
flexibility in terms of income shifting compared with pass-through entities
like LLCs and S corporations. When an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity,
its members must pay taxes on their share of the profits, whether or not that
money stays in the business or is distributed to their personal account.

By contrast, C corporation owners are taxed only on the actual amount they
receive as dividends. By working with a tax advisor, you can allocate your
business’s profits in such a way to take advantage of lower income tax
brackets. For example, if your business made $90,000 in profits for the year,
you could choose to leave $50,000 in the corporation as corporate profit and
take $40,000 in salary.

## **3\. Social security and Medicare taxes**

LLC members are not considered employees, so their share of the profit is not
subject to social security or Medicare tax. However, LLC members who actively
work in the business need to pay self-employment taxes on their income
(including salary and their share of any profits). However, with a
corporation, only the salaries are subject to social security and Medicare
taxes. Any profit distribution isn’t subject to these taxes.

Keep in mind that an LLC can opt to be taxed as a corporation. In this case,
only the member’s salary is subject to social security and Medicare and not
the profit distribution.

## **4\. Ability to deduct a loss**

LLC members who actively work in the business are able to deduct the
business’s operating losses on their personal tax return to offset other
income. C corporation shareholders are not able to deduct these losses but S
corporation shareholders can.

## **5\. Employee benefits**

In terms of perks and benefits, there are some key differences between an LLC
and a corporation. First, certain retirement plans, stock option and employee
stock purchase plans are only available for C corporations. In addition, LLC
members (as well as S corporation shareholders who own more than 2 percent of
the business) need to pay taxes on certain employee benefits like health
benefits, employer contributions to HSAs or FSAs, and life insurance benefits.
Shareholders of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

When it comes to choosing a structure, there’s no single right answer that
works for every business. You need to think about your financial situation and
future plans to determine the optimal structure for your needs.
