Protect Your Personal Information in a Disaster

As we've sadly witnessed from recent events, disasters--be it hurricanes,
earthquakes or wildfires--are an inevitable fact of life. And just as you
might create a disaster plan to protect your house and your personal
belongings, you should consider protecting your personal and financial
information as well.

Think of securing your personal information in the same way you think of
boarding up the windows of your home. To protect your personal life
"inventory," you should back up, document and record all your personal and
financial information. Additionally, if you haven't done so already, you need
to create tangible records (photos, videos or otherwise) of your personal
belongings for insurance claim substantiation purposes.

You should store these records outside your home, preferably in a safe deposit
box or fireproof safe. Additionally, you should consider scanning these
records and saving them electronically, either on a CD or DVD or through an
online backup service.

It's also a good idea to give a trusted friend or relative, as well as your
financial planner, a copy of these records with instructions on what to do if
something were to happen. Keep in mind that if these folks are close to you
geographically, should a disaster strike, it may hit them, too. So you may
want to consider giving one copy to someone who is in a different geographic
region.

Your personal inventory should include copies of the following critical
documents:

  * birth, death and marriage certificates
  * Social Security cards
  * passports
  * credit card numbers
  * medical records
  * identification, including your driver's license
  * recent bank and brokerage account statements, house deeds, mortgage and home equity notes
  * car title
  * insurance policies and agent contact numbers
  * credit and debit cards
  * tax returns for the past three years
  * the location of wills, trusts and powers of attorney
  * names and contact numbers for executors, trustees and guardians
  * a list of financial advisors and their contact information
  * a list of user IDs and passwords for your online accounts

Your personal inventory should also include photographic records--either
photos or videos--of such personal belongings as jewelry, furniture, computer
and stereo equipment and anything else of value, either personally or
monetarily. Along with the visual representation of these items, it's also
helpful to create a document describing each of your valuables. In addition to
the description, this document should include the item's cost, age,
manufacturer, and model and/or serial number. Insurance companies will also
want to see copies of receipts or appraisals for any expensive items,
including jewelry, artwork, antiques and collectibles.

Though this task may sound daunting, all these documents are necessary in the
event that you have to rebuild a financial life in the wake of a disaster.

Finally, when thinking about disaster planning, it's also a good idea to think
about contingency planning, especially when it comes to your legal affairs.
With that in mind, this is a perfect opportunity to review your legal
documents to determine whom you've named as an agent. If you haven't already
done so, consider adding a contingent agent--a backup person who makes
decisions in the event that your primary agent can't--to your wills, trusts,
durable powers of attorney, medical directives and so on. Once again, keep
geography in mind and think of naming individuals in different parts of the
country in order to cover all your bases.
