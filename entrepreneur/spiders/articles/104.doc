4 Best Practices to Avoid Startup Failure

The forces of failure are constantly working against you as an entrepreneur.
It takes a strong will and an unrelenting purpose to find ways in which your
startup can sustain success and avoid becoming yet another statistic on the
“10 business practices to avoid” list (which just may be the title of a future
article).

To mitigate the chances of failure, here are four startup best practices to
help you along:

## 1\. Maximize your resources.

In this day and age, obtaining information isn’t the challenge -- it’s sifting
through the endless streams of data, insights and email exchanges that soak up
more time than the analyses themselves. There are myriad online tools
available for entrepreneurs (nothing better than Entrepreneur.com, of course)
such as [Startup{ery](http://startupery.com/) and
[Efactor](http://www.efactor.com/) that serve as consortiums for best
practices.

Meanwhile, trying to [navigate the rough waters of information
overload](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238825) wastes precious time.
Pick your battles wisely. Know when you need to tackle an issue and when it
makes more sense to delegate. [Building a better business with outsourcing
tools](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/204652) such as
[Amberly](http://www.amberlymiller.com/) or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is a
great way to keep the grind wheel churning when your energy reserves are low.

## 2\. Leverage your network.

There are five types of people in your network: family, friends, uppers,
downers and influencers. Family and friends speak for themselves, and may also
serve as mentors or role models.

Uppers is a term for generally positive people -- they’re not strategists and
they don’t execute well but they love life and have fun sitting in the dark.
Their evil twins, however, are downers, who are the human toxins that act as
social hand grenades because of their negativity.

Finally, there are influencers. This latter group is key because they are the
ones who can connect you with others and others to you. Remember also that
everybody is a mix of the aforementioned types. Nobody is just an influencer
or just a friend -- everybody knows something worthwhile. The key is to know
when to leverage the right people at the right time.

## 3\. Build a learning culture.

Culture is a product of the people, processes and systems that define the
company’s name and all that it stands for. You don’t change a culture without
changing behavior, and you only change behavior at scale through the systems
and processes that guide the company’s daily execution.

In his book, _[The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous
Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses](http://www.amazon.com/gp
/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325
&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjeffbossco-20&linkId=ESZDYDIGJRQ7

following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can
be taught.”

The only bridge to startup sustainability is how willing you are -- as a
leader and a company -- to adapt to changes in the environment. Success or
failure is only determined by where you stop.

## 4\. Have an MVP.

No, not an individual. A minimum viable product is the least amount of product
or service you can bring to market while achieving two objectives: maximizing
value to the customer and minimizing costs.

Good judgment only comes from experience, and experience typically comes from
bad judgment. The toughest lessons to learn are usually the most costly in
terms of resources and capital, so the best practice for you is the one that
keeps your business unique.
