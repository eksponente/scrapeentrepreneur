Getting paid and money management can be tricky business because, in addition
to customers, cash flow and managing your accounts properly is what keeps your
business humming along. Consequently, getting paid in full and on time, as
well as understanding money management, has to become a priority, even if you
elect to hire an accountant or bookkeeper to manage the books. You will still
need to familiarize yourself with basic bookkeeping and money management
principles and activities such as understanding credit, reading bank
statements and tax forms, and making sense of accounts receivable and payable.
You also have to give careful consideration to the purchase payment options
you offer customers, including cash, checks, debit cards, credit cards and
online payment options, as well as establishing payment terms and debt
collection in the event of nonpayment.

## Opening a Bank Account

Once you've chosen a name and registered your business, you will need to open
a commercial bank account. Setting up a business bank account is easy. Start
by selecting the bank you want to work with--think small-business-friendly--
and call to arrange an appointment to open an account. There's not much more
required than that. However, when you go, make sure you take personal
identification as well as your business name registration papers and business
license, because these are usually required to open a commercial bank account.
The next step will be to deposit funds into your new account (even $100 is
okay). If your credit is sound, also ask the bank to attach a line of credit
to your account, which can prove very useful when making purchases for the
business or during slow sales periods to cover overhead until business
increases. Also be sure to ask about a credit card merchant account, debit
account, and other small business services.

## Bookkeeping

When it comes time to set up your financial books, you have two options--do it
yourself or hire an accountant or bookkeeper. You might want to do both by
keeping your own books and hiring an accountant to prepare year-end financial
statements and tax forms. If you opt to keep your own books, make sure you
invest in accounting software such as [Quickbooks](http://www.quickbooks.com/)
or [Quicken](http://www.quicken.com/) because they're easy to use and makes
bookkeeping almost enjoyable. Most accounting software programs allow you to
create invoices, track bank account balances and merchant account information,
and keep track of accounts payable and receivable.

If you're unsure about your bookkeeping abilities even with the aid of
accounting software, you may wish to hire a bookkeeper to do your books on a
monthly basis and a chartered accountant to audit the books quarterly and
prepare year-end business statements and tax returns. To find an accountant or
bookkeeper in your area, you can contact the [U.S. Association of Chartered
Accountants](http://www.acaus.org/) or the [American Institute of Professional
Bookkeepers](http://www.aipb.com/) . In Canada, you can contact the [Chartered
Accountants of Canada](http://www.cica.ca/) or the [Canadian Bookkeepers
Association](http://www.c-b-a.ca/) .

If you're only washing windows on weekends to earn a few extra bucks, there's
little need for accounting software or accountant services. Simply invest in a
basic ledger and record all business costs and sales. Since you are doing it
on your own, be sure to use a commonsense approach when calculating how much
to invest in your business vs. expected revenues and profits. Also remember to
keep all business and tax records in a dry and secure place for up to seven
years. This is the maximum amount of time the IRS and Revenue Canada can
request past business revenue and expense information.
