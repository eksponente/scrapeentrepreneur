Why You Need a Credit Policy

In this tough economy, many business owners are finding that customers who
have always paid on time are struggling to stay current. Other customers who
were already slow payers are falling farther behind or are unable to pay at
all.

Now is the time to create a credit policy to keep your existing customers, get
paid and stay in business. This policy should include clearly outlined
procedures and actions for when someone can't pay so you can immediately take
steps to help your customer and protect your business.

The first step is to look at your accounts receivable report and ask yourself
who owes you money, how much they owe and how past due is the account. Those
delinquent accounts should take precedence; work on making calls to get them
paid. Do not let any other customers charge anything until you check their
credit; doing this will help you minimize your risk and go a long way toward
presenting your company as being serious about your business.

Becoming the squeaky wheel serves two purposes: It lets your customers know
from the get-go that you are serious and will not let anything slide. It also
gets older, past-due balances paid off, because squeaky is annoying, and the
only way to make it go away is to pay the bill.

What do you do now when a customer becomes past due? Are you running into
problems when you contact your past-due customers? What have you tried to do
to get paid or to get control of your accounts receivable?

Immediately make a list of things you want to happen when a customer becomes
past due. You may want to make a personal visit, send a friendly reminder or
make a phone call. Decide what will work best for you and what you have the
time to execute. Write down three steps you can take when an account gets past
due, post it by your computer and start doing those things each time someone
goes beyond the terms agreed on.

Next, make a list of things to do when customers give you some common excuses.
That way you aren't thrown off guard when it happens; you'll have an answer
ready and an action plan. For example, when a customer tells you the check is
in the mail, don't just say "OK" and hang up. Step one might be to ask for the
check number, then ask for the check amount. I have been doing collections for
a long time; many times debtors will tell you the check is in the mail and
when it arrives, it is for an amount less than they owe. Verify the dollar
amount. If they tell you a lesser dollar amount than you are looking for, ask
them why it is less and set up a payment time for the balance. You can also
ask when and where it was mailed. Post these questions next to your computer
so that when someone gives you this excuse, you are ready and can take the
next step immediately.

Something to think about: 50 percent of a credit manager's time is spent
resolving people problems related to poor communications and follow-up.
