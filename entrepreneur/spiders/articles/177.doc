Why You Need Emotional Intelligence to Run Your Family Business

280

[Emotional intelligence](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/emotional-
intelligence) is the ability to manage emotions well in yourself and recognize
others’ emotional needs. Leaders who are emotionally aware have a knack for
reducing conflict and building lasting relationships -- two qualities that are
beneficial to businesses of all kinds, but particularly family businesses,
where the line between personal and professional matters is easily blurred.

When you lead with emotional intelligence, you can improve attitudes and
levels of motivation among family and non-family members. The results of
developing emotional intelligence also include higher performance, more
productivity, cooperation and collaboration.

Here’s some advice on how to lead with emotional intelligence.

## Get in touch with your own emotional triggers

What happens when the activities required to push your family business forward
creates more work than you can handle? Do you have to get work done with
family members who are even more stressed than you? Your internal and external
response to stress and conflict in family relationships affect the way you do
business. Even if you wear the mask, keep silent and immerse yourself in busy
work, negative emotions that are stored will show up in the decisions you make
and increase or deplete your energy levels.

One way to analyze how and why you react to triggers in your work environment
and in your relationships is to take personality tests. These are assessment
tools designed to help you understand your orientation and what energizes you.
Popular tests include the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, DISC and 360-Degree
Feedback. Your scores will shed light on your preferred style of handling
people and projects. Once you understand your own predispositions, you can
work on better ways to deal with conflicts that arise when your preferences
clash with others, or avoid them altogether.

## Become a better communicator

Entrepreneurs and leaders who display high levels of emotional intelligence
excel at communication skills.

Of course, the words you speak account for a small percentage of what
transpires during your communications with others. Your body language and tone
is largely attributable to what the other person hears and the interpretations
they make. Even on the phone, it's not so much about your words; it's about
your tone. As you can imagine, this gets amplified in family relationships.
Many people are guarded and cautious about their tone when dealing with non-
family members. Sometimes, those guards don't exist when it comes to those
closest to you. Pay closer attention to what you say and how you say it.

## Get others to say yes

Leading with emotional intelligence consists of your ability to influence
others. One of the biggest mistakes that some owners of family businesses make
is to strong-arm their families into taking on roles and responsibilities.
It's sad to see so many businesses end because the next generation wanted to
run far away from their family. If you lead with emotional intelligence, then
you will have a better chance of creating a family business that's built to
last. Developing emotional intelligence empowers you to influence others with
your passion, thoughts, ideas and vision. Your team will produce far beyond
what you would get if they are solely motivated by a paycheck or job security.

## Cash in on credibility

Credibility is critical to growing your family business. If you're not able to
manage your emotions well, then you will lose credibility. Imagine trying to
get your team to take on more responsibility if you're constantly yelling or
flying off the handle. What about trying to gain the confidence of employees
who you've cornered to gossip about your brother or cousin? Everyone is
watching you. Worse, they're watching you after hours, too. They're reading
what you say on Facebook, who you're appearing with in public, what you say
and do when your family business partners are not in the building. Leading
with emotional intelligence means that you carry the attitude that all eyes
are on you. It's critical that you embody the values and principles you want
to see in your family business.

Training is the best way to learn, develop and improve  your communication
skills. Find interactive seminars that incorporate real examples and address
your specific issues, personalities and past history.

The results of developing emotional intelligence extend far beyond success in
business. It might be what you need to strengthen your family.
