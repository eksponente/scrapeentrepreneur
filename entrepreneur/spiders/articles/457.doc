Keeping Track of Your Credit Score

Spring is in the air, but before you turn to cleaning up the garage or weeding
out old files from your office, it's time to do a hearty spring cleaning of
your credit history. Even if you're not currently in need of working capital,
forecasting business cycles is always an imperfect science, so you never know
when you'll need a cash infusion--or when one of your potential business
partners or vendors will decide to check up on your credit.

Since what you don't know about your credit history can hurt you, the time to
assess your credit is before you need it. "We get so many calls from
entrepreneurs in distress because they were denied credit and they badly need
working capital," says Lathea Morris, co-founder of the [Credit Alternative
Group](http://www.thecreditalternative.com/), a Montclair, New Jersey, company
that helps small businesses and individuals gain access to capital. "One of
the first questions I ask is, Did you check your credit report before you
applied for financing? I would have to say that 80 percent do not."

Now it's easier than ever to get the facts. As of September 2005, thanks to
the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, consumers in all 50 states can
get their credit reports for free each year from each of the three bureaus--
Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union--by visiting
[www.annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com/). Since your
personal credit history is inexorably tied to your business, you'll want to
review all three carefully, as well as pay to get your FICO credit score, well
in advance of needing capital. Fighting inaccuracies and repairing credit can
take time, says Howard Dvorkin, president and founder of [Consolidated Credit
Counseling Services](http://www.consolidatedcredit.com/), a nonprofit
financial counseling agency based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. "You're not
talking a few days; you're talking a few months."

Once you have all three reports, scan all personal information for accuracy.
"Something as simple as two numbers on your Social Security number being
inverted could eliminate your chances of getting credit," says Dvorkin. Next,
address any inaccurate late payments or charge-offs. Don't be afraid to call
creditors and ask them to remove one-time late payments. If you're tenacious,
"99 percent of the stuff can be removed," says Dvorkin.

If you can't have an item deleted, send an addendum to all three credit
bureaus explaining the reason for the late payment. "It won't improve your
score or get [the item] off there, but when lenders review your credit
profile, they can take that into consideration," says Brad Stroh, founder and
co-CEO of the Freedom Financial Network, a consumer debt resolution company in
San Mateo, California.

Next, order up your small-business credit report from
[D&B](http://www.dnb.com/). For $129, you can get a comprehensive analysis of
your business's creditworthiness. For $329, you can sign up for D&B's
SelfMonitor service and receive unlimited access to your business's report, as
well as e-mail updates notifying you of any changes. "A lot of vendors and
business lenders will review that," says Stroh, so you're better off finding
out the information before they do. And to keep your personal credit as
insulated as possible, Stroh also recommends asking to have any personally
guaranteed trade lines or credit cards transferred solely to the business once
your company gets a few good years under its belt.

Speaking of credit, there may be no better time than the present to take stock
of your business's cash flow and outstanding balances to make sure you're not
extending yourself too far. As of January, most credit card issuers have
agreed to comply with guidance issued by the Treasury Department's Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators stating that cardholders
should pay back more than their minimum payments to chip away at the
principal. With interest rates rising, that could mean trouble for small
businesses with big balances, says Stroh. "Entrepreneurs who were living month
to month may really need to do a gut check now and [ask], Do I have the right
financial game plan in place?"

The bottom line on your credit review: Even if it doesn't feel like a priority
next to the pressing tasks related to running your business, make it one.
Getting a clear look at your company's credit position today can help you not
only address the past, but plan more accurately for a successful future.
