staff at Entrepreneur Press and writer Jacquelyn Lynn explain how you can get
started in the freight brokerage industry, from your first steps to hiring
employees, marketing your business and managing your finances. In this edited
excerpt, the authors offer details about the types of forms you'll be using as
a freight broker. _

As a freight broker, once you match a load to be shipped with a carrier, you
must fill out a number of forms. First, you and the carrier need to enter into
an agreement covering current and future dealings. The [Transportation
Intermediaries
Association](http://www.tianet.org/AM/template.cfm?section=Home) provides
sample agreements in its New Broker Kit, but experienced freight brokers
recommend you develop your own contracts, agreements and forms, customizing
them to your particular operation.

Once you have a carrier agreement on file, you need to send the carrier a load
confirmation and rate agreement form for each specific load. When the carrier
picks up the load from the shipper, the shipper will give the carrier a bill
of lading listing the goods being transported and any special arrangements the
driver needs to make for the load. When the driver reaches the consignee
(recipient of the shipment), he needs to have someone there sign for the load.
If an independent contractor unloads the freight at the consignee’s location,
the driver needs to obtain a contract labor receipt from this worker.

Depending on your arrangement with the carrier, the driver or trucking company
will invoice you, the shipper or the consignee for transportation services.

**Carrier/Broker Agreement**

The carrier/broker agreement outlines the terms under which you'll work with a
given carrier. It’s designed to apply to all the dealings you have with that
carrier and should also provide for any future changes.

When writing the carrier/broker agreement, make sure to do all the following:

  * Note the carrier’s motor carrier (MC) or license number, full corporate name and address.
  * If you'll be working with this carrier on a contract basis, state that the freight and rates will be negotiated for each shipment.
  * State that the carrier is liable for any damage or loss to the freight that occurs while the carrier transports it.
  * Note that the carrier is responsible for any personal injury or damage to vehicles or equipment that occurs while the freight is in the carrier’s possession.
  * State when the carrier will receive payment and what the carrier must provide before you will pay (such as bills of lading).

**Load Confirmation and Rate Agreement**

Once a carrier agrees to move a given load, you should complete and send a
load confirmation and rate agreement form. This should include the name and
address of both the shipper and the consignee, a trip number (for tracking
purposes), any information on extra pickups or stops, pickup and delivery
dates, a brief description of the commodity to be shipped, and your commission
or brokerage fee structure.

**Bill of Lading**

At the time of the pickup, the shipper will provide the driver with a bill of
lading. This form will include information on the nature and size of the load,
its destination and any required special handling. The driver signs the bill
of lading as an acknowledgment of receiving the load described by the shipper.

The bill of lading is prepared and handled by the shipper and the carrier. As
the broker, you won't be directly concerned with it, but you need to keep a
signed copy in your files. The carrier usually sends this to you, along with
its invoice for transportation services.

**Contract Labor Receipt**

Drivers may occasionally work with contract laborers who unload trucks once
they reach the consignee. If they do, the laborer will give the driver a
contract labor receipt, which the carrier sends to you. The driver or carrier
pays the laborer and turns to you for reimbursement. If your shipper is
willing to cover this cost, pay it. Even if your shipper doesn’t want to pay
for contract labor, you may want to consider absorbing the expense so you can
maintain good relations with the driver and carrier.

**Invoices**

After making the delivery and obtaining proof of delivery, the carrier sends
you an invoice, along with the bill of lading. With these documents, you can
prepare your own invoice to send to the shipper. (Unless, of course, the
carrier bills the shipper directly.)

Your invoice should include the billing date, the dates of pickup and
delivery, the origin, and destination, what was shipped (commodity, pieces and
total weight), and additional fees (such as fees for exceeding weight limits
or charges for contract labor). Bill your shipper as soon as you receive the
complete invoice and bill of lading from your carrier.

If the shipper is sending the delivery “collect,” then you bill the consignee
rather than the shipper. The shipper should provide you with billing
information on these shipments.

**Contract of Carriage**

A contract of carriage isn't a document itself, but it’s important that you
understand the concept and what it includes. Many otherwise well-informed
transportation professionals view the bill of lading as a contract of
carriage—a common misconception. “A bill of lading is certainly a receipt used
in a contract of carriage, but there are many elements required by that
contract that are generally not stated on the bill of lading,” says freight
broker Bill Tucker. “Some examples: the price agreed to in the contract, all
the services to be provided, rules to be used to handle exceptions, and
accessorial charges that may be applicable.”

What makes up a contract of carriage? “A contract of carriage between a common
carrier and a shipper with or without a broker being involved usually consists
of some form of bill of lading, plus all the tariff provisions, pricing, rules
and service descriptions,” Tucker says. “Also, part of the total contract is
the intent of the parties; the regulatory rules that must be followed, whether
federal, state or local; and all the other usage of trade and precedent within
which this transaction has occurred.”
