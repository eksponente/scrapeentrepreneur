Corporate Collateral

Finding money to grow your company is as critical to the success of your
business as securing customers. But it's probably 10 times more difficult.

The stumbling block is figuring out where to get it. Banks? Venture
capitalists? Selling stock? Or something else? Business pundits agree-debt is
_not_ the best way to grow a business. Unfortunately, many businesses won't
achieve growth that attracts venture capitalists, and angel investors may not
provide enough. So who's left?

How about a Fortune 1000 company? Many corporations invest time and money
developing partnerships with other businesses that can add value to their own.
According to [Venture Economics](http://www.ventureeconomics.com/), a Newark,
New Jersey, private equity research firm, there are 117 active corporate
venture programs (including actual funds) in the United States. These
corporate investors range from highly focused technology investors, like CMGI
and Safeguard, to actual funds like Mustang Ventures, the venture-capital
group of Siemens Information and Communication Networks Inc.

Wayne, Pennsylvania-based [Safeguard](http://www.safeguard.com/), for one, is
looking for "companies in e-communications or e-business," explains Steve
Andriole, senior vice president and chief technology officer. "Then we ask
general questions about market size and trajectory."

For the more than $1 billion Siemens Mustang Ventures fund, the goal is
threefold, says Vernon J. Stevenson, vice president of Santa Clara,
California-based [Siemens Information and Communication
Networks](http://www.mustangventures.com/). "We want to find innovative
technology through hot start-ups. Second, and similar to any venture
capitalist or firm, is achieving a nice return; and the last goal is to be a
mechanism for internal business units-for ideas from employees that can spin
off into start-ups."

How do you locate corporate investors? According to Stevenson, try a company's
Web site. Look for offices of business development, corporate or strategic
planning, or strategic or corporate alliances. Also, try the "contact us"
section of the site or simply call them directly.

Another good strategy: Meet with corporate investors at conferences that bring
investors and entrepreneurs together. The IC2 Corporate Investment & Strategic
Alliance Conference is a good start. It's slated for October 31 in Dallas. For

Always remember that demonstrating how you add value to the bottom line will
lead to success.
