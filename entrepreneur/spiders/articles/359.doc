Building nests for high-tech start-up firms is what technology incubators do
best. Offering the use of modems, computers, networks and affordable office
space, an incubator could be the perfect place to launch your new business.
And with the National Business Incubation Association (NBIA) estimating that
25 percent of U.S. incubators focus on technology, there's probably one near
you.

"There's been a steady movement [toward incubators for high-tech companies],"
says Dinah Adkins, executive director of the NBIA. "They generally have strong
sponsorships and are well-funded, so they [tend to] last longer."

Baltimore's InfoAge Business Centers and New York City's Plug `n' Go program
are two such technology incubators that welcome fledgling entrepreneurs.

The private, for-profit InfoAge currently covers the Baltimore-Washington, DC,
area, and plans to expand across the Eastern United States over the next five
years. Its first building contains wired space for rent on a monthly or hourly
basis. Like most traditional incubators, InfoAge also offers business support
services such as copy machines, networking seminars and forums, and voice
mail.

InfoAge is also designed to meet the needs of a variety of virtual companies.
Entrepreneurs can purchase monthly packages starting at $29.95 for a computer
and 35 hours of T1 Internet access; $129.95 per month adds a mailbox and
address, unlimited T1 Internet access, Web site space, and conference and
multimedia presentation room use. The cost of renting office space varies with
the unit's size and location.

Likewise, in the Information Technology District of downtown New York City,
the Plug `n' Go incubator is in full swing. A joint project of the Alliance
for Downtown New York, New York City's Economic Development Corp. and several
area property owners, the program consists of six buildings and 440,000 square
feet of Internet-ready office space. At press time, there were 175 signed
leases with an estimated 1,547 employees.
