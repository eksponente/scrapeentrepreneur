Financing With Wiggle Room

In June, entrepreneur Megan Decker received a business offer that was just too
good to pass up: the ability to purchase her much larger competitor.
Financing, however, could be tricky for the company, a supplier of traffic
control equipment for work-zone projects. Because her business was so
seasonal, cash flow didn't follow the same steady pattern that most finance
payments must. Decker therefore hoped for some flexibility in the financing
arrangements for the multimillion-dollar deal.

"I need a lot of operating capital in the spring to get off the ground
because, at that point, I'm getting employees back from being laid off for the
winter months. I have pretty high startup costs with my labor and equipment
purchases to perform these jobs in the summer," explains Decker, 28, president
and founder of $9.5 million Mega Rentals Inc. in Madison, Wisconsin.

While her spring startup costs are high, the bulk of her payments don't
usually trickle in until late fall. Decker thought it was a lot to ask of a
lender to structure loan payments around that cash-flow schedule. Much to her
surprise, however, locally based First Business Bank agreed to tailor a loan
payback schedule that closely matched her company's seasonal cash-flow cycle.
"They addressed the fact that I have seasonality [in] my cash receipts by
tailoring my revolving loan so that I'm paying the larger principal payments
in November, which is when I will actually have the money," Decker explains.

"It's a tremendous advantage for me as far as my cash flow is concerned," she
adds. "They took a long look at my business and understood what I was
attempting to do with this acquisition, and why it made sense for my business
to pursue the purchase of this other company."

Though Decker insists she would have found a way to fund the acquisition even
without the flexible financing, she admits it would have required a stressful
balancing act. "Instead of worrying about the things I need to do on a day-to-
day basis to be successful," she says, "I would have been much more concerned
with being able to work around an already established structure of financing
that I didn't have as much input in."
