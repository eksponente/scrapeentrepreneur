Non-Tech Businesses Can Get VC, Too

Take one look at the 2004 "MoneyTree Survey" by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Thomson Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Association, and
you'll see that most venture capital goes to companies that develop cutting-
edge technologies. The siren call of high tech, nanotech, and biotech seems
impossible for VCs to resist.

But there is good news for low-tech companies. Behind the headlines, many VCs
are investing in low-tech (or no-tech) companies that offer prospects of rapid
growth, job creation and excellent economic return. In fact, well-managed
companies in any industry can score VC dollars if they know where to look.
Following are lessons from three low-tech entrepreneurs who found financing
gold.

#### Right on Target

At first glance, [Summit Partners](http://www.summitpartners.com/), a private
equity and VC firm with offices in Boston, London and Palo Alto, California,
looks like any other high-tech venture fund. Since 1984, the firm has invested
more than $5.5 billion in more than 250 companies, including Silicon Valley
icons McAfee and WebEx. But as managing partner Joseph F. Trustey says, the
firm is not blind to nontechnology opportunities: "Tech investments represent
only 40 percent to 60 percent of our portfolio. Our real growth areas over the
last couple of years have been low-tech-consumer products, healthcare,
business services and financial services, for example."

One of Summit's most surprising investments is in family-owned Tippmann
Pneumatics Inc. TPI, founded in 1986, supplies air-powered guns called
"markers" for the sport of paintball. The company met Summit's initial
criteria--revenue, profit, strong management and an industry-leading product
but Summit was skeptical about the market size.

"We had no idea how big an industry paintball was," says Trustey. "We
initially thought there wasn't much for us here. But what jumped out at us was
the size of the market and very attractive industry dynamics."

Paintball is now the fastest-growing extreme sport in the U.S., according to
SGMA International, a sporting goods manufacturers association. Dennis
Tippmann Jr., 33, who was president of the company when he found out about
Summit Partners, says his company was riding that wave. "By 2004, we were
growing over 20 percent a year for five years," Tippmann says.

In 2004, the Fort Wayne, Indiana, company's growth became overwhelming, and
the Tippmanns knew they needed new management. "That was one big reason [to
look for VC]. The other reason was to do a recapitalization," says Tippmann.

Although Summit Partners normally leaves existing management in charge when
they make an investment, they agreed to help the Tippmanns search for a CEO.
"They were very upfront with us--they said it was a situation where we'd need
to bring new management in," says Trustey. "That's representative of them
being great entrepreneurs."

Within three months, Summit Partners had written a check. Some of the capital
purchased shares from the Tippmann family, while the rest went into the
business to fund further growth. The company was renamed Tippmann Sports in
July 2004, and Dennis Tippmann Jr. happily stepped out of the role of
president to head up product development, an area that he loves.

With the help of Summit's extensive contacts, Tippmann Sports hired a new CEO,
allowing the whole family more time to enjoy their success. "I think it was a
win for both sides," says Tippmann.

Trustey agrees: "We are always looking for market leadership, companies
growing faster than their underlying sectors, and opportunities for liquidity
with exceptional returns. Tippmann Sports continues to exemplify that."
