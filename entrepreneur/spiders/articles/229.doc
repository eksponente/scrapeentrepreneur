Just over a year ago, [National Direct](http://www.nationaldirect.net), a
sports collectibles business in Toronto, needed the funds to acquire inventory
for a major sales campaign. While the $5 million company had an established
track record, conventional lenders weren't convinced of its ability to turn
over the inventory. When a business's need for a loan is not based on a
purchase order, banks and factoring companies are often tough to deal with.

For National Direct, the solution was finding a firm specializing in inventory
financing--Los Angeles-based [Inventory Capital Group LLC](http://www.icg.us).
The financing company initially provided $400,000 to fund the sale of a pin
collection licensed by World Wrestling Entertainment. Shortly thereafter,
National Direct obtained an additional $1.2 million to roll out a
commemorative pin collection featuring the Boston Red Sox.

As a result of the financing partnership, National Direct's sales have more
than doubled, says company president Kevin Johnstone, 44, and its distribution
network now includes more than 2,000 U.S. and Canadian retailers. Says
Johnstone, "It certainly allowed us to make a very large footprint in the
market that a traditional banking avenue would not have given us."

#### Significant Sales

Inventory financing fills a unique business-funding niche. It's geared toward
companies that have major sales opportunities but lack fund-raising clout with
traditional lenders. Here's how it works, generally speaking: A financing firm
purchases inventory stock directly from manufacturers on the borrower's
behalf, holding those items until that borrower has a firm buyer, usually a
customer with a credit card. Those funds are then deposited into a lender-
controlled account to pay down the inventory loan.

National Direct's lender, Inventory Capital Group, makes its money by marking
up the inventory it purchases on the client's behalf, usually by 5 percent to
14 percent. While this is not the cheapest type of financing you can find, it
can be a good option if you need to buy inventory but don't have a purchase
order (provided, of course, you have a good plan for getting the inventory out
into the marketplace.)

While the firm has financed deals as small as $13,000 and as large as $2.2
million, its preferred financing range is $200,000 to $500,000. And as a
general rule, it prefers not to extend funding to companies concentrating
solely on any one client. "It's difficult when a person comes in and says,
'I've got the Costco order that I've been working on for two years. It's 10
times my annual sales volume last year, and by the way, they can return it if
it doesn't sell.' Those are hard for me to fund because there's so much risk
concentrated in whether or not that inventory sells through at the store
level," says Inventory Capital Group CEO Todd Kesselman.

He's also reluctant to fund inventory used in heavy-labor production
processes, such as sheet-metal fabrication, because the "majority of value
comes from input from labor into the item after it's purchased," Kesselman
explains. "The item is in the middle of transformation, and I can't take the
risk that the company [will] operate long enough to continue transforming the
item."

#### Proven Plan

To qualify for inventory financing, businesses need a proven process for
converting inventory into cash. "We perform a strict viability analysis on the
business," says Jeffrey Koslowsky, executive vice president of [Gerber Trade
Finance](http://www.gerbertradefinance.com) in New York City, who finances
deals as large as $3 million. "Are they doing the right things to stay
successful? Do they hold too much inventory? When they are stuck with too much
inventory, do they know how to liquidate and move the product quickly through
closeout channels? Do they know how to collect receivables? We focus on the
trade cycle, how well they turn money and how well they run their business.
The track record is vital."

Borrowers must also be able to comply with their lender's rigorous reporting
demands, such as providing accurate and timely information on shipments,
returns and accounts receivable. That may entail significant procedural
changes for some companies, though inventory lenders argue that businesses
should already have those monitoring mechanisms in place. "It actually ends up
being good because [the lender] will go back and crunch [the company's] model
and see if there are some bad signs coming up. They'll be able to analyze it
and call you up and say, 'We have a couple of concerns,'" says Steven
Friedlander, 36, founder of [SKF Global Inc.](http://www.skfglobal.com), a
distributor of household items in Hackensack, New Jersey. For instance, the
lender may warn that the business is "sitting heavy on inventory" or that cash
flow has stalled, he observes.

Friedlander, who initially struggled to find regular funding for his 9-year-
old company and had to borrow from friends, appreciates the flexibility that
inventory financing offers. "When you bring goods from [Asia], it takes, from
the date the goods ship, a good 30 to 40 days to get them into your
warehouse," says Friedlander. He notes that it can then take companies up to
90 days to complete the transaction and get paid, making the typical 120-day
terms reasonable.

In addition to providing working capital, inventory financing allows the
funding recipient to obtain discounted pricing because it gives the business
the funds to purchase in larger quantities. What's more, an inventory-
financing arrangement often gives entrepreneurs the leverage to negotiate more
favorable payment terms with vendors, enabling them to wait longer to pay
without incurring late fees and interest charges. "They've been running so
thin that their vendors are used to a whole litany of excuses, because every
time they've had to pay a bill, they've been short money," Kesselman says of
companies that typically turn to inventory financing. "When we step in as a
third party and say [to vendors], 'The good news is, now they've arranged
financing, and when you give them 30-day terms, we'll pay on the 30th day,'
that credibility can sometimes open up terms."
