The Man Who Invented the Cubicle Went to His Grave Hating What His Creation Had Become

While the cubicle is today seen as a symbol of the drudgery of office work and
the control companies have over their employees, the design was originally
meant to give workers more freedom when it was first introduced in 1968.

In his book "[Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace](http://go.redirectinga

Saval writes that what we today call the cubicle was actually first marketed
as "The Action Office II," the second attempt of designer Robert Propst to
create a workstation that gave people individual autonomy and the ability to
work in a variety of settings.

Initially, the adjustable walls that make up the modern cubicle were meant to
be kept at a 120-degree angle, giving workers privacy when they needed it,
while also making them available to coworkers they wanted to speak with.

Inside the workstation, the Action Office II contained pushpin walls that
people could personalize, several levels of shelving, and room for both a
standing and sitting desk. The idea was to give office workers a flexible
space that allowed them to move seamlessly between their various individual
and collaborative tasks.

Saval writes that the design, produced by the office furniture company Herman
Miller, was met with public acclaim, including a _New York Post_ column titled
"[Revolution Hits the
Office](http://newspaperarchive.com/us/pennsylvania/chester/delaware-county-
daily-times/1969/06-03/page-12)."

Of course, many companies were more interested in saving money than providing
their employees with flexible working arrangements. So once they figured out
they could put people into a smaller space by repositioning the walls to form
a box, that's exactly what they did.

As other companies began to copy the design, their versions increasingly were
marketed as the small, closed boxes modern workers are familiar with â€” in
contradiction to Propst's original intentions.

By 1997, three years before Propst's death, _The New York Times_ estimated
that upward of 40 million Americans were working in cubicles. It was then that
Propst [told _The
Times_](http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/081197cube.html) that
he had designed the Action Office II to "give knowledge workers a more
flexible, fluid environment than the rat-maze boxes of offices."

Instead, corporations had perverted his intent to cut costs.

All Propst had left was this final denouncement of what his creation had
become: "The cubicle-izing of people in modern corporations is monolithic
insanity."
