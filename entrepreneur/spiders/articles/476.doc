Find Investors for Your Business

**Q:**_My company needs an influx of operating revenue. How do I find investors for my business?_  
**A:** Your first question should be, "How much do I need?" If we aren't talking millions of dollars, friends and family are some of the most dependable resources for any entrepreneur. If you've already tried that, you should consider other options, such as a small-business loan, an angel investor or venture capital.

Finding investors is really a matter of networking. Unless you get lucky, it's
going to take some time. For starters, talk to your banker, who may want to
offer you a loan, and may also know potentially interested investors. You
should also talk to your chamber of commerce, as well as any business
organizations you belong to.

Not surprisingly, the internet can help you find angel investors and VC groups
fast. Check out the [National Venture Capital Association's
website](http://www.nvca.org/). Under the "Resource Area" tab, you'll find
numerous descriptions of, and contact information for, regional VC
associations, such as the Atlanta Venture Forum and the Colorado Venture
Capital Association. Angel investors aren't quite as organized, but there are
organizations that match up angel investors and entrepreneurs. [Active
Capital](http://www.activecapital.org/) is one national angel investor
organization. [Angel Capital
Association](http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/)is another; it will lead
you to approximately 200 regional sites across North America, including
[Alliance of Angels](http://www.allianceofangels.com/), which is based in
Washington state and focused on high-tech operations.

You could spend all day on the web looking at the organizations available
before you even decide who to contact. But be warned: Unless you have a
business plan, you're not going to get far. Everybody--save maybe your Uncle
Mel, who might not be as discriminating--will want to know what you intend to
do with the money that you want invested in the company. They're going to want
a solid five-year business plan that includes projections and details how your
business makes money, who your customer base is and how you intend to market
to them--almost no detail is too trivial. So before you search for investors,
buy some software or a book that can help you write a plan, or go to an
organization like [SCORE](http://www.score.org/) or your local [Small Business
Development Center](http://www.asbdc-us.org/) and ask for help with writing a
business plan.
