Steve Jobs' Pivotal Life Moments (Infographic)

Time may be linear, but the path between birth and death is filled with
twists, turns, backtracks and offshoots. If you’re very, very lucky, your life
path may eventually inspire others to follow in your footsteps, as is the case
with the late Apple founder Steve Jobs.

Jobs’ personal experiences, which span everything from learning about
electronics from his adoptive father to experimenting with psychedelic drugs
(the spinning rainbow wheel makes a lot more sense now), helped make him the
creative perfectionist that changed the tech industry and the world as we know
it.
