Looking for Investors Abroad

It looks like 2005 is the year U.S. venture capital shakes off its tarnished
reputation and gets back to business as usual. There's a growing pool of
venture dollars just waiting to be put to work. Investments are up. Valuations
are up. What more could you ask for?

How about a million-dollar investor that can also bring you entry into huge
new markets, cutting-edge technology and teams of development engineers?
That's just what entrepreneurs are getting when they look beyond--way beyond--
the usual lineup of U.S. venture funds.

#### Distance Vision

Adi Sideman, CEO of [Oddcast Inc.](http://www.oddcast.com) in New York City,
looked all the way to Japan for both money and markets. Oddcast makes web-
based avatars--lifelike animated characters that act as virtual hosts on
companies' websites. The company has over 3,000 customers throughout the world
but needed a shot in the arm to grow to the next level. "We were looking for
strategic investors, not just institutional investors," says Sideman, 35.

It didn't take long for Oddcast to find Itochu, one of the largest
conglomerates in Japan. "Between 2001 and 2004, they watched our progress and
eventually invested in us," Sideman says. "Today, they are one of our best
partners." Since Oddcast was built with money from angel investors, Itochu is
the company's only institutional investor.

And what an investor: Besides deep pockets, Itochu has operations in
everything from textiles to satellites, including deep R&D capabilities and
broad distribution in the vast Japanese mobile-phone market. The Itochu
partnership quickly had Oddcast's avatars packing up their bags and moving to
thousands of websites around the world. Oddcast's avatars will soon appear on
mobile-phone screens and provide mobile-phone users with Tokyo's weather
forecast or updates on the Hanshin Tigers' baseball scores.

"Multiple products have come out of this platform thanks to the Itochu
investments," says Sideman. And he's quick to point out that this kind of
business growth could not have come from U.S.-based venture funds, which
invest primarily for financial returns.

Japanese investors are less concerned about financial returns on their U.S.
investments than long-term strategic relationships, says Roger Brook of [Japan
Venture Partners](http://www.japanvp.com) in Raleigh, North Carolina. Japan
Venture Partners helps U.S. technology companies find strategic allies and
investors in Japan and other parts of Asia. "Financial criteria take a back
seat to the strategic considerations--what kind of revenues can they generate
by selling the company's product?"

"Most of the [Japanese] capital available for U.S. companies comes from
strategic corporate investors," says Brook. "Usually, some strategic
relationship has to happen first, before an investment is made." In the case
of Oddcast and Itochu, there was a clear strategic benefit to both companies
as they shared ideas and development tasks before the investment. And not
surprisingly, along with the investment, Itochu negotiated for the rights to
distribute the avatar technology in Japan.

If Asia is on your radar, do your homework, advises Brook. You'll probably
need to find a company with strong distribution capabilities in your market.
"In most cases, a company like Itochu may invest in a U.S. company," says
Brook, "but their real interest is in selling the product in Asia."

#### Awake at 3 a.m.

Michael Simon had his pick of VCs last year when he set out to raise $10
million for 3am Labs Inc., his 2-year-old software company based in Boston.
After all, Simon already had two $100 million successes under his belt,
including Uproar, a dotcom he sold to Vivendi Universal in 2001. So why did he
choose to go halfway around the world to Budapest, Hungary, to raise money?

In a word: "Strategy," he says. It really wasn't about the money but about the
connections and know-how. "We tried to put together an international
consortium from the get-go," says Simon, 40. He ended up parceling out his
equity to three venture funds--one each in Boston; Budapest; and Palo Alto,
California.

The Budapest financiers--3TS Ventures--have connections around Europe and
strong experience in wireless networks, a particular focus for 3am Labs'
instant networking service software. "The managing partner [at 3TS] has very
specific experience that is very useful for us," says Simon. "In Europe,
you're simply more likely to find people with strong connections to Nokia and
Ericsson, for example, than you may find in the U.S." Those connections can be
key to developing software that works seamlessly with hundreds of millions of
mobile devices in markets around the world.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that 3am Labs has an office in Budapest, where
Simon spends about half his time. Besides a large team of software developers,
the office also supports the European sales staff, so the marriage to a
European VC was an important marketing move, too: 3TS Ventures is a key link
to customers. Says Simon, "A lot of the important customers in Europe are
quasi-state-owned companies--former monopolies like Deutsche Telecom. They've
really opened doors for us there."

#### Have Money, Will Travel

You don't need an office in Budapest to attract European investors, says
attorney Heather M. Stone, partner and head of the fund formation practice
group at Edwards & Angell in Boston. Stone has worked on both sides of the
table, helping U.S. entrepreneurs negotiate terms with foreign investors and
vice versa.

"Many foreign [investment] firms focus less on geographic criteria than on
what their fund is going to invest in," says Stone. Many Canadian, European
and Israeli funds, in particular, plan on making some or most of their
investments in the U.S. "Based on the technology they are interested in,
that's just where those companies are," she says. "They sort of back into it."

That should be welcome news for entrepreneurs in cities that lack a strong VC
presence. U.S. venture firms tend to be concentrated in the largest cities
like San Francisco and New York City, leaving many second-tier cities hungry
for capital. Looking overseas may be the right move for entrepreneurs in those
cities, especially entrepreneurs with products or technologies that can make
the leap to foreign markets.

Many foreign funds don't even have an office in the U.S., says Stone. "They
just get on a plane," she says. "Most deals are done on e-mail now anyway, so
there's some initial travel, but it's not a huge time commitment."

Whether you're looking for foreign markets and partnerships or just a new pool
of investors, don't limit your search to the usual suspects in the U.S. If you
expand your search internationally, you may find that international investors
are looking for you, too.
