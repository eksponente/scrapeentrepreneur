Branching Out

When direct marketing agency [Creative Direct Response Inc.](http://www.cdr-

Maryland, firm began looking for a company to acquire. It found Jeremy Squire
& Associates, an Oakton, Virginia, fund-raising company. Jeremy Squire, the
firm's owner, wanted to sell but was concerned about his employees. So
Creative Direct Response offered a buyout proposal that was not only
financially attractive, but also a means to reward loyal employees.

The $5.5 million firm urged Squire to sell his company stock to his employees
through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. Creative Direct Response
would pay Squire for the $3 million stock purchase, acquiring the company as a
wholly owned subsidiary. Because Squire provided financing, he could collect
interest that would normally go to a bank. And since his company was a C
corporation, he could defer capital gains taxes by using proceeds from the
sale to buy securities of U.S. companies, a permissible practice when a
business sells at least 30 percent of its stock to its employees.

Squire reaped big tax savings. His employees became shareholders in the
expanded operation, and the acquirer, Creative Direct Response, was able to
negotiate a lower purchase price. "If he had sold to some third party that
wasn't involved in an ESOP, he would have ended up paying between $400,000 and
$600,000 in capital gains taxes," says Geoffrey Peters, 57, president of
Creative Direct Response. "By deferring those capital gains taxes by
reinvesting in U.S. securities, we were able to purchase the company at a
lower price."

#### Cheaper Capital

By educating the seller about the tax advantages of an ESOP, Creative Direct
Response gained access to a cheaper source of expansion funds and secured the
$3 million in financing more easily than it would have with a conventional
lender. Fortunately, the tax benefits aren't limited to sellers of ESOP
companies.

Here's how it works: A company issues new shares and sells them to an ESOP,
which borrows funds to buy the stock. The company can use proceeds from the
stock sale to its own benefit-say, by acquiring a company. The company repays
the loan by making tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP. The interest and
principal on ESOP loans are tax-deductible, which can reduce the number of
pretax dollars needed to repay the principal by as much as 34 percent,
depending on the company's tax bracket. That tax shield didn't apply to
Creative Direct Response-as a subchapter S corporation, it doesn't pay
corporate income taxes. But the capital gains deferral made an ESOP
transaction appealing to its acquisition target.

Despite the significant tax benefits, the ESOP is an underutilized business
financing strategy. Experts blame it on a lack of awareness and misconceptions
about employee ownership. "The tax shield alone that the ESOP provides enables
an ESOP to give a small business more debt, more senior credit, than they
could get with other access to capital," explains Mary Josephs, senior vice
president of the Leveraged Finance Department at Chicago's [LaSalle Bank
Corp.](http://www.lasallebank.com), an ESOP lender. Lenders like ESOP loans
because tax savings boost cash flow, making repayment more likely. Also, the
lender's enhanced comfort level often translates into a larger loan than with
regular financing. The fund-raising strategy, however, is not for the fiscally
challenged; since business owners guarantee ESOP loans, their financial clout
and access to collateral are key lender considerations.

While ESOP lending hasn't hit the mainstream, lenders are getting more
familiar with it. Because underwriting hinges on the entrepreneur's credit
quality, even untrained lenders can get up to speed quickly. "You're better
off educating [your] bank on ESOPs because these loans are underwriting the
individual," Josephs says. And besides banks, investment-banking firms, mutual
funds and insurance companies may qualify as lenders as well.

Finding a lender is just one step in the ESOP planning process. First, the
firm has to determine whether the tax perks outweigh the cost of setting up
and administering a plan. "The business needs to be generating substantial
amounts of taxable income because that's the benefit," says Spencer Coates, a
CPA in Bowling Green, Kentucky. While costs vary depending on the number of
employees-a minimum of 20 is recommended-installing a plan can cost up to
$100,000 and run $10,000 to $15,000 annually, says Coates. But those expenses
are often a fraction of the tax gains an ESOP can generate. "Usually, first-
year tax savings offset the costs. That's what makes it palatable to small
businesses," he says.

But if your goal is quick access to capital, an ESOP loan isn't advisable. You
can spend up to a year working with legal and financial advisors to meet
requirements, such as obtaining an independent appraisal to value the
company's stock. Even with a specialized attorney, it still took months for
Creative Direct Response to complete its ESOP merger. "Find a lawyer who is
experienced," urges Peters, stressing that the complicated nature of the
transactions results in heftier legal fees than for a straight asset or stock
purchase.

Even if you've got time on your side, the financial strain created by buying
back stock from departing employees is another limiting factor. "The company
involved with an ESOP has to realize they have a repurchase obligation that
can be a demand on cash flow as the company matures," says J. Michael Keeling,
president of [The ESOP Association](http://www.esopassociation.org) in
Washington, DC.

#### Broader Appeal

Though ESOPs are complicated to install and administer, about 10,000 companies
now have the plans, up from just 200 in 1974. Insiders attribute much of the
growth to a 1998 rule change that allowed S corporations to sponsor the plans.
At the same time, companies recognize they can boost profits by giving
employees an ownership stake, which studies have shown enhances morale and
performance. "Statistics show if you have a meaningful percentage of ownership
and some communication that the employee's job impacts the value of the shares
they have in their accounts, these companies outperform their peers by a
factor of 10 percent on a compounded annual revenue and [EBITDA] growth
basis," says Josephs. "Although they give something up, what they have is
going to be worth more."

ESOP FABLES

Among employee benefit programs, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP,
is the most misunderstood. Perhaps the most common misconception is that an
ESOP will hinder your management style. "[Some people] think employees are
owners like the entrepreneur is the owner," says Mary Josephs, senior vice
president of the Leveraged Finance Department at Chicago's LaSalle Bank Corp.,
an ESOP lender. "They share in the stock appreciation of the company, but they
do not own the company."

But companies with an "open, friendly style of management" tend to make the
ESOP conversion with greater ease, says J. Michael Keeling, president of The
ESOP Association in Washington, DC. "If that company had an open environment
before they did the ESOP, it will be easier for them to make the transition.
But there is no law that mandates how you manage an ESOP company."

Another misstep companies make is skimping on setup fees. "You might save a
few bucks dealing with local providers who say they understand ESOPs, but in
the long run, you'll pay if your plan isn't done correctly," Josephs warns.
"Do your homework, and get recommendations from The ESOP Association and the
National Association for Employee Ownership."
