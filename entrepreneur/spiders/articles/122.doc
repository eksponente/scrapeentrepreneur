This Elon Musk-Backed Startup's Rocky Road to Solar 'Grand Slam'

Successful investors see around corners, bank on long-term trends and shrewdly
assess risk. Oh, and it also helps to know Elon Musk.

[DBL Investors](http://www.dblinvestors.com/), a $225 million impact
investment firm in San Francisco, had all of those factors going for its
investment in [SolarCity](http://www.solarcity.com/), now the largest solar
installer in the country, worth nearly $6 billion two years after its initial
public offering.

That SolarCity would become “a grand slam 10 times over,” as DBL partner Nancy
Pfund put it, was anything but inevitable in 2008, when DBL first invested in
the company. It certainly wasn’t clear at the time of its rocky IPO in
December 2012, when the stock debuted at $8 a share, far below its earlier
target price.

DBL became the first institutional investor in SolarCity at the invitation of
Musk, the billionaire co-founder of [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/home) and
now CEO of electric-car company [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/), and
commercial space pioneer [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/). Musk, the cousin of
SolarCity founders Lyndon and Peter Rive, put up the bulk of SolarCity’s
initial round of $10 million in financing. DBL worked closely with Musk on
Tesla and invested in SolarCity in 2008, its $30 million Series D fundraising
round.

“To a lot people, it looked like a bunch of solar installers. Why would you
invest in it?” Pfund recalled. DBL’s due diligence confirmed that the falling
cost of solar panels and the availability of government subsidies made it a
national brand that could multiply its revenues with incremental costs. “The
fact that this was just a bunch of roofing folks didn’t bother us.”

Lyndon and Peter Rive conceived SolarCity at the Burning Man arts festival in
2006, and it became one of the earliest U.S. companies to popularize solar
leasing, giving skittish customers a virtually risk-free proposition.
SolarCity installs solar systems for free in return for a power purchase
agreement that offers customers a 10 percent to 15 percent discount on their
utility bills.

The model depended on federal tax-credits for solar installations. Since
SolarCity owns the system, it could bundle the credits into tax-equity funds
that attract corporate buyers. The buyers get a 30 percent federal tax credit,
along with portions of lease payments. SolarCity has raised nearly two dozen
investment funds through which $1.57 billion has been committed. (The tax
credits legislation expires in 2016.)

Demand for tax-credits dried up in the Great Recession. At the same time, the
bloom came off of clean-tech, generally, with [the notorious bankruptcy of
Solyndra](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/06/us-solyndra-
idUSTRE77U5K420110906), a manufacturer of solar energy modules, and a broader
shakeout of solar panel producers caused by plummeting prices and competition
from China.

But what was bad for solar-panel manufacturers was good for solar installers
like SolarCity -- and for consumers. [Panel prices have
dropped](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/progress_report--
advancing_toward_clean_energy_future.pdf) 60 percent since 2011 and continue
to fall. Residential solar installations have grown at an annual rate of 70
percent for the past five years. Last year, new photovoltaic panels installed
in the U.S. had the capacity to [generate up to 4.2 gigawatts of
electricity](http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2013/03/solars-
momentum-faces-opposition-from-fossil-fueled-legislation), about as much as
four nuclear reactors.

SolarCity raised more than $500 million in equity financing prior to its IPO,
according to [CrunchBase](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/solarcity).
Other investors included venture capital firm [Draper Fisher
Jurvetson](http://dfj.com/). In 2011, SolarCity won a five-year, $1 billion
government contract to install solar panels on 120,000 buildings at 124
military bases, funded entirely by the private sector.

None of that was enough to overcome solar skeptics of the company’s IPO. “The
world hated solar. They didn’t understand it. They thought we were a module
company,” Pfund recalls. The company had hoped to raise $210 million through
its IPO; it ended up with $92 million. The opening share price was ratcheted
back from $13 to $15 a share to $8. Musk stepped in to buy $15 million of the
shares and DBL an additional $2 million to bolster the stock.

Since then, the share price has climbed to near $70. SolarCity’s market share
is also increasing, with more than 26 percent of the residential solar market.
That’s higher than the next eight solar rivals combined.

Last year, SolarCity arranged $500 million in lease financing with Goldman
Sachs, the biggest such arrangement ever for U.S. residential rooftops. It
announced an agreement with Honda to provide car buyers with home solar
systems at little or no upfront cost. The company also entered the
crowdfunding arena, scooping up startup Common Assets, and acquiring its
software that allows individuals and smaller companies to invest in solar
panels.

SolarCity is now piloting a plan to provide Tesla battery packs to SolarCity
customers. The batteries will allow customers to store electricity during peak
production and use it during dips, smoothing solar power production and
helping stabilize the grid.

DBL has earned a handsome return on its investment in SolarCity. “We saw the
opportunity early, that traditional investors would not have seen,” Pfund
says. “Not every company will be as big and successful, but we want to have
some of them. They are the role models for the next company. The whole
ecosystem for entrepreneurial companies depends on having some big successes.”

## Impacts

**Financial:** SolarCity has yet to become profitable, but deployments continue to grow. The company had more than 141,000 customers at the end of June, more than double a year earlier. It aims to deploy more than 500 megawatts of solar-generating capacity in 2014 and 1,000 megawatts in 2015.

**Social and Environmental: **SolarCity has installed solar systems at more than 400 schools, avoiding more than 80 metric tons of carbon. According to the company, the Chico Unified School District in California will save more than $3 million over 20 years.
