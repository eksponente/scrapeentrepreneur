A Quick Guide to Tax Extensions

Let's face it. If you're just starting to think about your taxes now, it's
probably too late for you to learn what you need to know between now and April
17. So I've got one word for you--just one word: extension!

If you're a sole proprietor or single member LLC, you can get an automatic
six-month extension of time to file your return (to October 16, 2006) by
filing IRS Form 4868, "Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File
U.S. Income Tax Return", by April 17. This form is available as a free
download at [www.irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov). You don't have to explain to
the IRS why you need an extension; they just give it to you. An extension of
more than 6 months cannot be granted if you are in the United States.

If you have a partnership, a corporation (regular or subchapter S) or an LLC
with more than one member, you should still file Form 4868 for your personal
tax return. But you will also need to file IRS Form 7004, "Application for
Automatic 6-Month Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax,
Information, and Other Returns", by April 17 in order to get an automatic six-
month extension to file your Form 1065 (for partnerships and multimember
LLCs), Form 1120 (for corporations) or Form 1120-S (for subchapter S
corporations). These forms are also available as free downloads at
[www.irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov).

Last but not least, you'll also need to file applications for an extension of
time to file your state income tax returns These forms vary from state to
state, but they're usually available as free downloads from your state's tax
authority. Go to [www.natptax.com/state_information.html](http://www.natptax.c
om/state_information.html) and click on your state when the map of the United
States pops up. You'll then be linked to your state tax authority's website.
Click on "Forms and Publications," or search on the site for "extension
forms."

When it comes to tax extension, keep in mind one important thing: When you
file for an extension, you're only getting more time to file your tax return
paperwork. If you think you'll owe the federal or state government any taxes
for last year, you cannot extend the time required to pay your taxes. You'll
have to "guesstimate" the amount you owe and pay it along with your Form 4868
or Form 7004. Otherwise, you'll incur interest and taxes on the overdue
payment and make yourself more likely to be audited down the road. If, of
course, you think the IRS owes you money, you won't be able to get it until
you actually file your return.
