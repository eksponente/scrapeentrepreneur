VCs Want in on Your Hot New Company

Armed with fresh funds to invest, a growing number of VCs are hoping for a hit
with earlier-stage companies. According to the third-quarter 2006 MoneyTree
report, a quarterly study from PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture
Capital Association based on data from Thomson Financial, early stage
investing was on the rise, with 35 percent of all VC deals going to seed or
early stage deals, compared to 31 percent the previous quarter. Funding for
expansion-stage companies, meanwhile, fell 10 percent. "We've seen a few firms
looking at more early stage opportunities, realizing that [those] are the
riskiest but have generated the highest return," says Christopher Meldrum,
managing director of seed-stage firm Golden Pine Ventures in Durham, North
Carolina.

But research shows that VCs are placing smaller bets on these young companies.
Says NVCA president Mark Heesen, "Investors are telling early stage
entrepreneurs that they're [getting] fewer dollars to be used over a longer
period of time. Those entrepreneurs have to be much more disciplined in [how
they] spend that money."

Likewise, the bar remains high for companies seeking venture capital in the
first place. "One thing we did, because we knew the bar would be high coming
out of the dotcom hangover, was to do a superthorough job of our homework,"
says Daniel Neal, 48, CEO and founder of [Kajeet](http://www.kajeet.com/), a
mobile phone service company for tweens that raised $27 million in its first
round of financing in January 2006. "An executive I admire once said to me,
'Doing a startup is like having a final exam every day,' and I truly believe
that."
