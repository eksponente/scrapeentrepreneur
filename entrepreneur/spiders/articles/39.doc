5 Ways to Get Your First Customer

Do you know the difference between a startup idea and a startup company?

Paying customers.

I’m not talking about the .1 percent of big-name startups that raise millions
of dollars in venture capital and build up a user base of millions before they
need to make any money. I’m talking about the 99 percent of company founders
who rely in part on bootstrapping, raise $500,000 or less in investment
dollars and have to figure out how to generate revenue to stay in business.

Early adopters are a very special breed of customers and they mean everything
to a business. These customers don’t need testimonials to make a purchase.
They understand that errors will happen. They are patient, interested in your
company's success and willing to pay for your product or service.

The number of early adopters you need may vary. If you sell a $100,000 product
or service, you may need onlly one or two. If you sell something for $1, you
may need hundreds or thousands to truly prove that the marketplace is
interested in your product.

Early adopters are more commonly known as your first customers. Here are the
five things you can do to[ find
them](http://www.entrepreneur.com/marketing/findingcustomers/):

## 1\. Use every relationship you have.

It’s hard enough to make cold calls, but it’s extremely difficult to sell new,
innovative products and services using that method.

You need to meet with people who have some connection to you, no matter how
slight.

When I started my first company, my clients were supposed to companies. I sat
down and made a list of everyone I knew who owned a business and came up with
only five names. This was very discouraging.

But I decided to grow my list by tapping my existing relationships, so I met
with almost every person I knew who might have ties to the business community
and asked people to introduce me to five business owners. I was surprised by
how willing people were to help. I quickly grew my list of prospects and even
snagged a few early customers.

## 2\. Stalk and awe.

Some potential customers will always be totally out of your reach but might
make incredible early adopters. I like to employ my signature "Stalk and Awe"
campaign. First, I stalk these people -- not the kind of stalking that’s an
unwanted, obsessive intrusion on someone’s personal space that can lead to
arrest.

Find anyone who might have a connection to the person you want to meet and ask
for an introductory email or a warmup call. The harder this person is to
reach, the more recommendations you'll need. Next, send a letter of
introduction and follow up with a call. Locate opportunities to attend events
where the person will be so you can “run” into them (networking and business
events only). I'm not suggesting crashing a wedding or joining the person's
gym.

If you're able to arrange a meeting, now awe this person. Do research on
potential problems in his or her business. Spend the first half of the meeting
asking questions to locate possible pain points for that person and try to
offer something of value independent of your business. Then if you bring
enough value to the table and awe this person, he or she will be a lot more
interested in you and your company.

## 3\. Accentuate the positive.

When you speak to potential customers, they might have all sorts of questions
without great answers: "How many other customers do you have? How long have
you been in business?"

Try to answer them by accentuating the positive: "How many other customers do
I have? That number isn’t as important as the fact that of those who have
tried my product or service, 95 percent would recommend it to their friends."

Or "How long have I been in business? I have years of experience in this
market segment but recently opted to bring the same quality service that I
offered through such and such big company but at a much lower rate."

## 4\. Create partnerships for credibility.

No one has heard of your startup and you have zero brand credibility. So why
not use the credibility of an existing, trusted company to score your first
customers? Find a group or a person that your target customers trust. This
could be someone who already provides them services or just a  person with
renown. Offer this potential partner a percentage of certain kinds of revenue,
a sponsorship agreement or the chance to be a customer for a discounted rate
in exchange for a public endorsement.

## 5\. Become an expert.

When you don’t have a track record of happy customers, the next best thing is
having expertise in your chosen domain. If you can get your early customers to
trust you as a knowledgeable resource in your subject area, they will buy from
you. The key here is not to fake it. Before you start to prove your expertise,
you have to develop it.

Once you've developed your expertise, express it through any media resource.
Tweet, post on Facebook or your blog or write a guest blog to spread the
message. Write a white paper and email it to target clients. Put together a
"lunch and learn" seminar and invite customer prospects to learn about your
subject area.

Fight the urge to spend all your communications trying to sell your company.
Use your platforms to try to help people and your first customers will follow.
The first customers will breathe life into your startup.
