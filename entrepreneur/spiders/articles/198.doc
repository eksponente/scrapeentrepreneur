Cross That Bridge

When [Regenesis Biomedical Inc.](http://www.regenesisbiomedical.com), kicked
off an aggressive sales campaign to cultivate a new customer segment, it
marked a major-and risky-shift in the equipment company's longtime marketing
strategy.

In 2001, Regenesis launched and started promoting its Provant Wound Closure
System, which stimulates cells to replicate and express genes faster, to the
home-care industry. But strict Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules
severely limited its marketing base to certain private insurance clients.

So after extensive study of the health-care reimbursement structure, Regenesis
shifted its focus in 2002 to medical institutions, whose flexibility in
Medicare and Medicaid billing granted greater access to patients insured by
the government-sponsored programs. While the potential payoff was significant,
the strategy wasn't without financial risk. The company thought medical
facilities were more likely to rent rather than buy the equipment, so the
nearly $10 million firm, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, manufactured hundreds
of the wound-healing devices. "Once that was in place," says president and CEO
Daniel Puchek, 51, "we needed a sales force. Although we use independents and
dealers, that costs a lot of money. You need to advertise and do trade shows
to support sales. If you don't, you will never move the rental fleet. Those
are the risks." Indeed, deciding how aggressively to fund the growth campaign-
for which the firm had raised $4.5 million from investors as of last November-
is a constant challenge. Says Puchek, "We need to focus very stringently on
managing costs. At the same time, we have to invest to grow the business. And
the two, in many ways, are diametrically opposed."

Balancing growth with the related financial risks is one of the greatest
challenges confronting a developing business. Ultimately, the extent to which
a business is willing to assume debt to capitalize on growth is strongly
correlated with the owner's attitudes about risk. While known for their nerve
at start-up, most entrepreneurs settle into a more conservative strategy over
time. Business owners who fail to seize growth opportunities may also have
tunnel vision. As a result, they don't recognize that inadequate capital is
hindering growth.

The core of a cautious mind-set is often the desire to avoid a cash-flow
crisis by not over-investing in growth. "They're not always patient in terms
of the point where their investment may start to pay off," says Gregg R. Wind
of CPA firm [Gregg R. Wind & Associates](http://www.windcpas.com) in Marina
del Rey, California. "If they're investing in machinery, it may take six
months or a year to reap the benefits." In truth, financially fit firms can
often wait a few years for profits to kick in after major spending.

While impatience is one explanation for a firm's hesitation, fear of debt is
another. For some, credit anxiety is so pervasive that measures taken to avoid
debt are counterproductive. An example is the firm that funds major purchases
with cash, depleting reserves later needed for economic or market upheaval. "I
don't think anybody likes their business to be referred to as highly
leveraged," Wind says, "but in a setting where a proper amount of analysis is
undertaken, debt doesn't have to be a bad thing."

Entrepreneurs often consider debt a risky prospect given that they have less
control over the business as it gets larger. The reality is that the best
entrepreneurs aren't always the best managers, and those who fail to recognize
their limitations can stall growth.

Other entrepreneurs are so absorbed in everyday tasks that they fail to
consider strategy in a broader sense. Business customers of First Business
Bank in Madison, Wisconsin, often get a wake-up call when the bank shares the
results of its annual client reviews. Many are shocked at what the analysis
reveals. "It may show them that things are trending down, and their growth and
profitability are leveling off," observes Corey Chambas, the bank's president
and CEO.

Business owners needn't rely on financial advisors for such information. For a
start, they can analyze industry data collected by trade groups to identify
trouble spots and pinpoint opportunities. Meanwhile, holding strategy sessions
for key managers will ensure that opportunities aren't missed due to unfounded
fears and a lack of communication. "Your salespeople might believe there's an
opportunity to penetrate a marketplace," says Chambas. "And your head of
operations [tells] you that you have the capacity to do the additional
production if you bring in another press or whatever it is you do. Your CFO
might think there's a good enough return."

Even owners who aren't particularly risk-averse grapple with everyday choices
that can alter their cash-flow position. For Regenesis, deciding how many
medical devices to produce is one of them. "They have to be built in lots of
fifties or hundreds," Puchek says. Consequently, the firm often has to
purchase more devices than it has rental orders. Despite the dual challenge of
protecting cash flow while simultaneously preparing for growth, Puchek is
confident about the company's long-term prospects: "We know the business
model. Now it's a matter of managing our cash and pushing to get where we want
to be."

When extra capital is the antidote to sluggish growth, debt-averse
entrepreneurs should bear in mind that they often have more control over
funding issues than initially thought, says Wayne H. Stewart Jr., associate
professor in the Department of Management at [Clemson
University](http://www.clemson.edu/spiro) in Clemson, South Carolina. While
large lenders typically require borrowers to maintain financial ratios related
to debt coverage and working capital, smaller creditors may offer more
flexible terms. "If you're taking on additional debt, does the bank have
covenants that restrict your operating decisions?" Stewart cautions. "And how
much autonomy are you willing to give away?"

As Puchek can attest, soliciting input from creditors and investors can help
relieve the stress of growth decisions. Those advisors can not only help firms
avoid such pitfalls as burning through capital too quickly, but also prevent
them from adopting an ultraconservative strategy that stifles development.

**Weighing the Risks**

When investigating a business opportunity that requires a significant capital
outlay, a comprehensive cost/benefit analysis can reveal its long-term profit
potential-or the financial impact of a possible loss. "Simply add up the value
of the benefits of a course of action, and subtract the costs associated with
it," explains Gregg R. Wind of CPA firm Gregg R. Wind & Associates in Marina
del Rey, California.

An example, Wind says, is a sales director deciding whether to implement a new
computer-based contact management and sales processing system. The sales
department currently has only a few computers, and its salespeople aren't
computer savvy. Any system upgrade would require extensive employee training.
The company is likely to experience a drop in sales during the transition
period. While total expenses, including equipment, installation and training
costs, plus lost productivity, are estimated to be $55,800, the company's
analysis reveals the new computer system would increase sales capacity, boost
efficiency and enhance customer service and retention-financial benefits the
company pegs at $90,000 annually. Based on the cost/benefit estimates, the
company would see a return on its investment in eight months. (Payback time:
$55,800 ï¿½ $90,000 = 0.62 of a year.)
