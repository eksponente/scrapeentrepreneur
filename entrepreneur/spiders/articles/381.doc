60-Second Guide to Collecting Payment

Collecting on overdue accounts can be a frustrating experience for a small
business owner, particularly during the start-up period when every dollar of
revenue counts toward staying solvent and repaying debts. It's not the most
pleasant part of being an entrepreneur, but not handling them expeditiously
will almost certainly endanger your business's cash flow and long-term
viability.

_**In just 60-seconds**, we'll show you how to establish a sound and rational
policy for collecting payments._

**0:60 Do What You Can to Prevent Late Payments**  
Establish a standard policy for payment and make your customers aware of them
before starting work. Some types of businesses may require all or a portion of
the payment up front, while others allow terms such as payment within 30 days
after receipt of invoice (i.e., Net 30). Your invoices should also clearly
state any surcharges for late payments.

**0:49 Be Careful with Credit**  
If you provide goods or services on credit, develop qualification standards
that are specific, yet fair (e.g., a good credit history from a credit bureau
or good bank references). Put your credit policy in writing and make sure all
employees understand it. You should also have the policy posted in your store,
or available as a handout.

**0:36 Take the Right Attitude**  
Your collections policy will do no good unless you enforce it. Do not shy away
from a potential confrontation, but avoid provoking it as well. If you've met
your obligation and a customer has not, you're entirely in the right.

**0:29 Find Out Why**  
On the other hand, don't assume the customer is entirely wrong. Contact the
delinquent account and ask politely for an explanation. It may well be that
the invoice has been lost or is awaiting approval. A customer with cash flow
problems may request extra time. How you proceed may be very situational.
Based on your experience with the customer, you may feel confident enough to
allow extra time or installment payments. Make sure you and the customer
clearly understand any compromise. Be flexible, but firm; and don't hesitate
to follow up.

**0:15 Take Stronger Action**  
If your collection attempts fail, it may be time to turn to an attorney or
collections firm. Terms for these services vary; they may require a fee and/or
a percentage of the invoice amount, or a retainer. Again, your course of
action will depend on the situation. You may decide the amount of the overdue
account does not justify the cost and effort to collect. If so, write it off
as a bad debt and move on.

**0:09 Don't Make the Same Mistake Twice**  
Most everyone deserves a second chance. Should customers with poor payment
histories approach you about working for them or restoring credit, don't
immediately refuse unless you are absolutely certain they remain bad risks.
Ask them to explain how their situation has changed and decide whether it
makes sense to restore the relationship. As a precaution, insist on stricter
terms such as advance payment or cash-only.

**0:03 Don't Go it Alone**
