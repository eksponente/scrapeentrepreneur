Build for One, Deploy to Many

The mobile content applications sector presents entrepreneurs with an ever-
widening target for fresh ideas. They need only to overcome the fragmented
technology nature of the mobile industry itself.

Devices such as the iPhone and the Droid have redefined mobile phone
capabilities, but device formats and software operating systems and carrier
delivery platforms are silos within silos, each requiring a single, usually
small, usually cost-challenged application developer to reinvent the wheel
every time it tries to land its app on a new device.

The folks behind Tarsin, based near Reno, Nev., have been studying this
problem long before game-changing devices hit the scene.

"The idea of designing once and delivering across a portfolio of devices
hasn't existed," says John Osbourne, CEO and co-founder of
[Tarsin](http://www.tarsin.com/). The company began life as a partner to
Osbourne's former employer, Motorola. Device makers traditionally don't
concern themselves with configuring apps to work on one another's devices
(kind of encourages comparison shopping). Tarsin developed Capsa, a widget-
style framework supporting apps to run on devices with different operating
systems, screen presentations and functional menus. Capsa doesn't replace the
software development kits designers use to create apps for specific phones; it
helps them make sense of a world in which so many SDKs exist in the first
place.

"There's a thin client in the platform that helps an app recognize what kind
of device it's delivering to, so you can have devices of different screen
formats sharing the app, and it works on both of them," says Mitch Harbaugh,
Tarsin vice president of marketing.

The cost and labor required to create apps again and again for different
phones likely has kept some developers out of the game. Tarsin's trying to
open the gates for entrepreneurs flummoxed about how to achieve mass-market
scalability.

It also solves the same pressing problem for megawatt corporate brands.
Hallmark, for instance, used Capsa to launch a mass-market mobile greeting
app, Osbourne says. "Many big corporate brands have wanted to do a mobile app,
have dipped a toe in the water and said, 'Shit, this is difficult.'"
