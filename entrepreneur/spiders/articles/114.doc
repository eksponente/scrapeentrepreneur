The 4 Roles Every Founding Team Should Have

Entrepreneurial success rarely comes from the idea. Instead, it comes from the
founding team’s never-say-die attitude and relentless execution.

And a startup can only be as successful as its founding team. When there's
rapid scaling up in size and limited resources, the composition of a founding
team is especially critical for what I’ve identified as [exponential
organizations](http://www.exponentialorgs.com/) -- or companies that have
impact (or output) at least 10 times larger than their peers.

The rapid pace of [growth](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/growth-
strategies) of exponential organizations requires an extra emphasis on a fully
synergistic core team. Peter Thiel, for example, told his co-founders (Elon
Musk, Reid Hoffman, Luke Nosek, Max Levchin and Chad Hurley) and employees
that they should all work together as friends rather than as employees. Not
only was PayPal very successful as a company, but the team is now known as the
[PayPal Mafia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia), whose members have
helped one another on other startups including Tesla, YouTube, SpaceX,
LinkedIn, Yelp, Yammer and Palantircompanies that today have a total market
capitalization exceeding $60 billion.

While synergy among founding members is important, diversity within the core
team is crucial. I’ve identified the following critical roles for founding
teams that are seeking exponential growth:

## 1\. The visionary and dreamer.

The visionary is the primary role in the company’s story. This role is usually
performed by the core founder with the strongest vision and a higher,
aspirational purpose for the company. For exponential organizations, this is
the "massive transformative purpose,_" _which aims to capture the hearts and
minds, imaginations and ambitions of those inside and outside the
organization.

The position statements of exponential organizations include declarations of
purpose that might have seemed outrageous in years past. Take
[Google’s](https://www.google.com/about/company/), for example. While the
intention to “organize the world's information” may have seemed impossible
many years ago, the company has made it a reality, becoming a [multibillion
dollar business](http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/07/investing/google-exxon-
market-value/) in the process.

Visionaries not only come up with the purpose for the company but also will
hold the organization to it.

## 2\. The customer champion.

Every company has end users. For example, Airbnb has guests and Uber has
passengers. To achieve success, startups should develop a user experience
role, someone who is purely focusing on users’ needs and who ensures that
every contact point with a consumer is as intuitive, simple and clear as
possible.

Many recognizable exponential organizations have made user feedback an
integral part of their company. Airbnb hosts and guests fill out evaluation
forms. Taxi disrupters Uber, Lyft and Sidecar encourage clients and drivers to
rate one another. And the news platform Reddit invites users to vote on
stories. Having someone attuned to user feedback allows for continual
improvement based on the market’s needs.

## 3\. The innovation architect.

In industry after industry, the development cycle for products and services
grows ever shorter. And just as was the case with the shift from film
photography to digital photography, now that the process is moving from a
material, mechanical basis to a digital and informational one, the match is
lighted for an inevitable explosion.

This makes programming and engineering more crucial than ever for tech
startups. Ensure that there’s a programming-savvy member on the founding team
responsible for bringing together the various technologies required to build
the product or service. Beyond ascertaining that the startup’s technology is
viable, the programmer or engineer is also key in identifying new ways to
leverage technology and information to create a unique and sustainable
advantage and business model.

## 4\.  The rainmaker.

A startup can have a strong vision and team members with technical finesse,
but neither matter if the product is not viable. Venture captialist Bill
Gurley recently remarked that the “burn rate,” or the amount of money that
startups are willing to lose to grow their business, is the [highest it’s been
since 1999](http://online.wsj.com/articles/venture-capitalist-sounds-alarm-on-
silicon-valley-risk-1410740054). This increased burn rate can lead to failure,
making it imperative to have someone serving in a dedicated financial role.

The person playing the financial and business function within a founding team
assesses the viability and profitability of the organization, which is key for
interactions with investors. Above all, the person in this position is also
responsible for managing the all-important burn rate, ensuring that the team
doesn’t peter out before the company gets off the ground.

Having a unified, yet diverse, founding team is the first step toward
achieving exponential growth. Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, co-founder of
Andreessen-Horowitz, noted the importance of shared passion in his [recent
book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Hard-Thing-About-Things/dp/0062273205), _The
Hard Thing_ _About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy
Answers_: “If founders are in a startup for the wrong reasons (money, ego), it
often degenerates into a nasty situation.”

Founders must be intrinsically motivated self-starters who deliver independent
thought and possess complementary skills. They must have complete trust in one
another’s judgment in the face of rapid growth and change. After all, a
startup is only as strong as its foundation.
