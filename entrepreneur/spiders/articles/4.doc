Dont Fire Them, Fire Them Up

What are the odds of a 33-year-old self-avowed graduate from Springsteen U
turning around the sales performance of a Xerox district office so
spectacularly that it makes national headlines?

Probably about as likely as Ed McMahon showing up on your doorstep with that
sweepstakes check in hand. Nonetheless, Frank Pacetta's story (told with Roger
Gittines) is true . . . and he tells it succinctly in _Don't Fire Them, Fire
Them Up: A Maverick's Guide to Motivating Yourself and Your Team_ (Simon &
Schuster, $23 cloth).

"If I had been my boss, I would have fired me at several points along the
way," confesses Pacetta. "Fortunately, I hung on and matured."

Pacetta matured enough to guide Xerox's Cleveland sales office to a first-
place regional finish within a year. Considering the office was nearly dead
last when Pacetta took the helm, that's no small achievement.

"[Leadership](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/218116) starts and ends with
people," says Pacetta, who emphasizes the importance of getting the highest-
caliber performance possible from employees. His [management
tips](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219553) run the gamut from
practicing what you preach (walk the talk, as he puts it) to backing up your
people. But it all centers around one crucial, unequivocal element: respect.

"What you need--and I don't care where it comes from--is respect for people,"
urges Pacetta. "If it's not there . . . forget management."

Entrepreneurs looking to improve their management skills will learn from and
enjoy Pacetta's words of wisdom. You're duly warned, however, that the author
doesn't take you on a free ride. "Dip into these pages," writes Pacetta, "find
something that makes sense, and . . . go do it! Don't expect me to do all the
work."

And you thought reading was supposed to be relaxing?
