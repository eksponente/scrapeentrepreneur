Turning Passion Into Profits

Q: My dream of starting my own business is finally becoming a reality, but I'm
still not sure I'm going to be a success. What do I need besides my enthusiasm
for my business to make it?

A: Many people work very hard to launch their own small business. They take
business courses, network with leaders in their community and do whatever it
takes to turn their dream into a reality. Then they are faced with something
they might not have thought about when they were planning their business: How
do you move from passion to profit?

In other words, as an entrepreneur, how do you bottle the excitement and
enthusiasm you have for your business and create a plan that will lead you
down a path to profitability? If you are like most people, the transition will
be a real wake-up call, and you may suddenly find yourself in panic mode,
struggling to meet payroll and cover expenses. But instead of panicking, start
planning. Planning will be the key to your success. Without a plan in place,
you are sure to fail. As a rule, most entrepreneurs hate to plan and instead
rely on the "shoot from the hip" management style.

To go from passion to profit, follow these simple techniques, strategies and
tips for managing your business successfully:

####  1\. Set goals.

Keep a written record of what it is you are trying to accomplish. This may
seem obvious, but I am constantly amazed at how many entrepreneurs do not take
the time to do this, often believing that their company is too "early stage"
or "unproven" to do this. No company or business concept is too young to
establish goals, measure success and hold workers accountable for progress on
the path to profitability.

####  2\. Communicate those goals.

Some business owners set goals, but then fail to share that knowledge with
others in the organization, employees, consultants and key business partners.
Some entrepreneurs are very good at communicating their passion about the
business concept and mission, but then fail to communicate their specific
business goals associated with revenue and profitability. It takes effort, but
it is essential to focus on communicating goals in order to make them
meaningful and create a shared sense of purpose.

####  3\. Have strategies to meet those goals.

While it is good to write down your goals and share them with your team, you
will still need a strategy to meet them. Smart business owners will brainstorm
with as many knowledgeable people as possible in order to find creative ways
to meet their goals. They will motivate employees by outlining the goals and
strategies with collective buy-in. They will do this on a monthly or quarterly
basis to ensure it's possible to hold individuals accountable for executing on
the strategies to achieve the goals.

####  4\. Recognize when goals change.

Sometimes your business goals will change, and you must be prepared to
respond. At one company I am familiar with, senior management holds mid-
quarter review sessions to realign goals based on the latest feedback from
clients, business partners and employees. The quarterly goals are adjusted to
reflect reality and keep employees motivated and chasing the prize. Whether
it's because of the economy, a client's preferences or other circumstances,
don't let change be your downfall. If you must change your goals, start now
and you'll be back on the right track. Stop procrastinating and start managing
like a winner-you'll be surprised at the results.

Moving from passion to profit is one of the hardest transitions most
entrepreneurs must make. It sometimes happens gradually as a matter of
necessity. It sometimes happens quickly as a result of planning or luck. And,
of course, it sometimes never happens. You can accelerate your progress on the
path to profitability by following some of the rules outlined above.
