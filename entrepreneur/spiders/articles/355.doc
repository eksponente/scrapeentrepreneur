Easy Access

The way O. David Dickson had it figured, his five-vehicle ambulance company
needed a new headquarters station in Warrenton, Oregon, if he was going to
cover his corner of the state properly. So when the right facility hit the
market in late 1996, Dickson jumped at the opportunity to buy it. Not only did
the available facility offer space for a sixth ambulance and crew, but it also
had ample room for a dispatch center and training facility.

There was just one hitch: money. The price of the facility was $200,000, and
when Dickson put everything he had on the line, his bank would only lend him
$140,000. "If I couldn't get the other $60,000, I'd lose the deal," Dickson,
53, recalls. "There were two other buyers behind me."

Dickson got his windfall from a little-known lending source, the Capital
Access Program (CAP), now operating in 20 states. By taking advantage of
Oregon's CAP, Dickson was able to coax another $60,000 out of the Bank of
Astoria and, with his war chest assembled, completed the deal. Today, Medix
Ambulance Service Inc.'s six ambulances operate round-the-clock to cover
emergencies in Clatsop County.
