Taking Your Annual Financial Pulse

An annual financial checkup is the most important part of the financial
planning process. Yet many people downplay its significance.

This annual review is an opportunity for you and your financial planner to
examine your financial planning action steps, or "to do" list, and measure the
progress you're making toward your goals. It's also a time to incorporate any
new life changes that have occurred during the past year--the birth of a
child, the death of a loved one, a new marriage, a business startup or
expansion, or even a major purchase--into your financial plan to help you
chart a new course, if needed, or to further affirm that you're on the right
track. Remember, your life is dynamic, not static, and your financial plan
should be as well.

During your annual review, you and your planner will want to revisit the
building blocks of your financial plan and review your resources, goals and
priorities to see what's changed. This act of monitoring and benchmarking is
beneficial because you'll get an opportunity to step back from your busy life,
review your goals, and confirm that your priorities remain the same. And you
and your planners get the chance to reconnect to affirm that you--and your
planner--are taking the right steps toward goal achievement or to refocus so
that you don't get too far off track.

In most cases, your first step will be to examine your short-term goals. Here,
your planner can recommend strategies that should be considered for time-
sensitive objectives. For instance, if you plan to purchase a home sooner
rather than later, your planner might suggest putting more aside for the down
payment and decreasing what you're putting into your children's college fund
just until you buy the house. Or the birth of a child may be the catalyst for
your planner to recommend purchasing additional life insurance.

Your planner may also use this time to educate you about new research that
either confirms the rationale behind your current financial plan or provides a
basis to alter your short-term or long-term strategies. For instance, new
research that shows the costs of nursing homes or health care during your
retirement years will escalate wouldn't change your goal of "secure, long term
retirement," but it could change the strategy necessary to achieve that goal.

Your planners should also discuss regulatory and other changes that could
either adversely or positively affect your financial plan. The new Medicare
Part D plan, for instance, could prove useful to some clients. If recent
changes will negatively affect you, such as recent changes in the federal
estate tax laws, then you and your planner can devise possible plans of
actions to get you on a better path.

You and your financial planners may also want to measure the performance of
your investment portfolio as part of the annual review. Typically, performance
should be measured against several benchmarks, the most important of which is
your own personal goals. For instance, if you and your planner had established
that your portfolio should grow by 5 percent annually before taxes, then your
portfolio performance should be measured against that yardstick. It's also
important that your portfolio be measured against standard benchmarks as a
point of reference. Meeting personal investment goals is far more important
than over- or under-performing the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

Much like your annual medical exam, an annual financial review isn't something
to put off. You need to take the time to examine your financial and life goals
in order to determine that you're on course to attain these goals. It's also a
chance to review changes that have occurred and begin to anticipate changes
that may occur in the future. And it provides the opportunity to implement any
new plan of action that's been developed in light of changing situations or
goals. Don't put off your review any longer--your financial health could
suffer because of your neglect.
