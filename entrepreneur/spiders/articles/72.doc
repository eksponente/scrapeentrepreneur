In Google Glass Case, Laws Again Lag Innovations

Innovation and [regulation](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/regulations) are
crashing on the highways of California.

A California woman was issued a summons for wearing Google Glass while
driving. It was an added charge, since Cecilia Abadie, of Temecula, was pulled
over on I-15 in San Diego County for speeding.

The California Highway Patrol officer said wearing Google Glass was akin to
watching television while driving, which is a violation of state law. While
California has [a love affair with
regulations](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227807), most other states
prohibit watching a television screen while driving (with the exception of
global positioning systems and mapping).

Under the California law cited by the CHP, drivers can't use “a television
receiver, a video monitor, or a television or video screen, or any other means
of visually displaying a television broadcast or video signal that produces
entertainment or business applications” which is “visible to the driver while
driving the motor vehicle.”

Abadie, who [posted the ticket
itself](https://plus.google.com/+CeciliaAbadie/posts/Kofr18UWLfc) on Google+,
claimed in the comments on her Google+ page that Glass wasn't on at the time
(though, in a spirit of subtle honestly, she said she “doesn't use it much
while driving”). Still, the officer interpreted it as a monitor which could
distract or disrupt her view.

Abadie's case bring up the age-old conflict that arises when new technology
doesn't fit into the narrow black and white of rules and regulations. Several
innovations become common, and yet are technically against the law. In some
states, earbuds, while allow people to stay compliant with the law while
talking on a cellphone hands-free, [actually run afoul of
laws](http://%5Bhttp://lifehacker.com/5902802/ever-wonder-if-its-actually-
legal-to-wear-headphones-when-youre-driving) that prohibit the use of
headphones while driving.

Google itself is clear that the laws are, well, unclear: "Most states have
passed laws limiting the use of mobile devices while driving any motor
vehicle, and most states post those rules on their department of motor
vehicles websites,” the company says on its FAQ page. “Read up and follow the
law!"

For her part, Abadie, 44, said she may fight the ticket.
