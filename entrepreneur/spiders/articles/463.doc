Investors Resume Funding Online Startups

If you missed the first internet wave, it may not be too late. Working with
new business models and boosted by investors' growing appetites for dotcom
startups, a second swell of online enterprises is emerging.

Venture capitalist Sam Jadallah of Mohr Davidow Ventures in Menlo Park,
California, says that since media giant News Corp. paid $580 million to buy
fast-growing online community-builder MySpace.com in 2005, entrepreneurs have
been working feverishly on internet business plans they hope will appeal to
consumers, investors and potential buyers.

Another reason for the return of interest in the internet: affordability. "The
cost to get into business and experiment is dramatically lower than it was in
the first boom," says Jim Fowler, 41, CEO of Jigsaw Data Corp., a San Mateo,
California, company founded in 2003 that helps members buy, sell and trade
business contact information. Open-source software, offshore programmers,
commodity-priced servers and other elements of internet infrastructure are
better developed, better understood and less costly than before, Fowler says.

The companies that are part of the resurgence employ an approach labeled Web
2.0. It calls for websites to actively involve users, who build the business
by contributing personal pages a la MySpace or valuable information like the
corporate executives' phone numbers and e-mail addresses bartered on
Jigsaw.com. "It's a lot more participatory now," says Di-Ann Eisnor, 34, co-
founder of [Platial.com](http://www.platial.com/), where users contribute maps
of favorite places. "[Users] don't just come in and read something; they come
in and do something."

While some ventures such as Jigsaw are directly monetizing information,
others, like Platial, plan to give the information away and sell
advertisements to businesses anxious to expose their messages. Eisnor's eight-
person Portland, Oregon, company was founded in September 2005 and has yet to
sell any ads. However, its promise was enough to gather seed money from well-
respected Silicon Valley investor Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers.

In another departure from the web boom of 2000, Eisnor hopes to lure local
businesses to place ads by charging mainly for the number of visitors who
click on advertiser links. "We're trying to make sure the local businesses can
see what putting their message on Platial.com is doing for them," she says.
"It's a lot more accountable this time around."

Entrepreneurs can expect to be held accountable to investors as well this
time. Capital is available, but first-round financing today typically comes
from angel investors putting up a few hundred thousand dollars, not the
millions VCs pumped into untested companies during the last boom. "The days of
raising $100 million for a concept not yet proven are behind us," Eisnor says.
As long as investors don't get carried away and pump massive sums of money
into unproven companies this second go-round, we shouldn't end up like last
time, with a savage downturn sweeping up even healthy companies, Jadallah
says.

It does seem that neither public nor private investors are anxious to throw
much good money after the bad that fueled the last wave of internet excess, so
competition will be fierce. Everybody, of course, hopes to be the next
MySpace, but a matter of broader significance is that the basic Web 2.0
approach may have inherent vulnerabilities which could derail this boom before
it gets far.

The biggest potential issue is the question of who owns the information that
these web services collect and display. [Jigsaw.com](http://www.jigsaw.com/),
for instance, traffics in information about private individuals. Fowler says
the tidbits in Jigsaw's databases are neither copyrightable nor trade secrets.
They might be considered private, however, and if they were, it might mean
trouble, but Fowler says he doesn't foresee any government action restricting
Jigsaw's ability to sell its service.

Services like Platial's stand on slipperier ground because they deal with data
someone else owns--the maps come from Google. Thus far, the search engine
titan is letting Eisnor and others use the maps for free. She expects to have
to start paying for the data, but what form that relationship will take she
doesn't know. "Those are questions we haven't needed to answer yet," she says.
"But we will this year."
