The ABCs of Online Sales Tax

_A reader sent in the following question to me recently in regards to sales
taxes on online sales:_

"I buy a lot of stuff on the internet for my business. Recently I bought
something in an online auction, and when the seller sent me his invoice, he
added my state's sales tax to my winning bid. I thought this was odd, because
the seller's located in another state and I didn't think you had to charge
sales tax on interstate sales. Is there something going on here I should know
about?"

Generally, when you're selling stuff--online or otherwise--you charge sales
tax only when the buyer is located in the same state as you. Under current
law, which may be changing soon (see below), you're not supposed to charge
sales tax on sales to buyers who live in other states.

There are two exceptions to this, however, and your seller probably fell into
one of them:

First, if the seller has an office, warehouse, distribution facility or retail
location in your state, the seller may have to charge you sales tax because he
is legally "doing business" in your state. This is why, when you buy something
from a mail order catalogue, the invoice form sometimes says "residents of
States A, B and C, please add sales tax to the total." The mail order company
has its retail or warehouse outlets in States A, B and C and is required to
collect sales tax from buyers located in each of those states, regardless of
the actual location your order is shipping from.

Second, a growing number of states are entering into "compacts," or
agreements, encouraging in-state sellers to collect sales tax from buyers in
neighboring states. [New York and Connecticut have such an
arrangement](http://www.tax.state.ny.us/pdf/memos/sales/m88_12s.pdf), while
eight Midwestern states have banded together to create the [Midwest Border Tax
Compact](http://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/forms/edu126.pdf). The idea is that by
charging your buyer state sales tax, you're helping the buyer avoid liability
for "use taxes" on stuff they buy from out-of-state vendors. (In just about
every state, the sales tax and use tax are the same rates and are calculated
the same way.) How thoughtful of them!

If you live in a state that has a reciprocal sales tax agreement with another
state, you're required to collect the other state's sales tax, pay it to your
state's Department of Revenue--with a special tax return form--and then hope
and pray they remit the tax to the other state government (of course they
will, won't they?).

So why haven't you heard about this before? Up until recently, most states
that have sales tax agreements with other states haven't been too aggressive
about enforcing them. Why, you ask? Now, I'm not a politician, but I suspect
it's hard to convince voters their tax dollars should be spent to help another
state collect its tax revenue. There are also a few U.S. Supreme Court rulings
that prohibit states from imposing sales taxes on interstate commerce, whether
directly or indirectly, and no state official wants to be accused of violating
federal law. But, as I mentioned above, the law may be changing soon.

Every few years, a bill is introduced in Congress, which would permit states
to levy taxes on sales made over the internet, among other things. A majority
of states have signed onto the [Streamlined Sales Tax
Project](http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org) or SSTP, which is basically a
national "reciprocal tax agreement," and are awaiting the "green light" by
Congress to put the SSTP into effect. The bill, which was previously voted
down, is being reintroduced in Congress this fall and stands a better-than-
average chance of getting passed this time around.

If the SSTP passes Congress, then internet sellers of all kinds--including
people putting stuff up for sale on eBay and other Internet auction sites--
will have to charge state and local sales taxes at the rates in effect
wherever their buyers are located. With more than 7,500 sales tax
jurisdictions in the United States, complying with the SSTP will impose a
crippling paperwork burden on many small e-businesses that can't afford to
hire teams of people or buy expensive software packages to help them comply.

A number of e-commerce companies and grassroots organizations are lining up to
fight the SSTP. For example, eBay's government relations department has set up
a [special website](http://www.ebaymainstreet.com) where you can sign up for
e-mailings notifying you of the bill's progress. You can also sign up to
receive "form letters" you can send by e-mail to your elected officials to let
them know the impact the SSTP will have on you.

Of course, your seller may simply have been mistaken in charging you sales
tax. Call him and find out. Also, if the stuff you bought from him is
inventory you're planning to resell, you shouldn't be charged sales tax at
all. So provide your seller with a "resale certificate" and he'll almost
certainly back off.
