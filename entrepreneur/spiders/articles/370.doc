Paying Vendors With Equity

**Q:** I have some people working on my company's business plan and am currently negotiating with another company to incorporate my ideas into a working Web site. I'm paying these people with equity. How much should I offer, and how much should I keep for myself?

**A:** Every deal is different. What you offer depends on your business, the contractors and the size of the opportunity. Your equity is your currency, and you've only got 100 percent to spend. Every but you spend now is less you can spend later.

You're buying goods, services and cash with equity. The equity's value depends
on the company's value. If you value the company at $10 million, then you
would offer 10 percent of the company for $1 million in services. Equity
negotiations involve valuing the company and basing percentages on the
negotiated value.

For example, if it's just you, an idea and a business plan, you may value your
company at $2 million. (In practice, $2 million would be high unless you have
proprietary technology, a prototype or some other reason to believe you're
viable.) You could then purchase $100,000 worth of goods for 5 percent
($100,000 divided by $2 million) of the company.

The problem with paying vendors in equity is you don't want your valuation
negotiations to hamper later negotiations with VCs. If you pay vendors using a
valuation of $1 million, a VC would be rightly skeptical if, two weeks later,
you claim the company's value has jumped to $10 million.

One solution is to structure the vendor's contribution as debt. The vendor
tracks time and materials and gives you a loan to cover their work. The loan
goes on your company's books as a note payable. During the first investor
round, the debt converts to equity at the same valuation the investors are
using plus a bonus (e.g., 40 percent) for doing the work on faith. Use a
lawyer with start-up experience when structuring this kind of deal-doing it
right may involve regulations and subtleties I don't know about.

Make sure anyone you pay in equity understands that their share will almost
certainly get diluted. If your round-one investors buy 30 percent of the
company, the original shareholders see their percentage ownership drop by 30
percent. Someone who had 10 percent will have only 7 percent after the
investors enter. In theory, however, you only accept an infusion of money if
it helps the company become worth enough to make up for the dilution.

As a benchmark, after your first professional investor round, you can expect
the equity to be split into thirds: one-third for the founders, one-third for
employees and managers, and one-third for the investors. Unless you wish to
reduce the founders' ownership, that only gives you 33 percent for attracting
your executive team and star employees. A CEO will often want 5 to 10 percent
of the company, so you want to be sure you have enough left over after paying
your contractors to attract the rest of your management team.
