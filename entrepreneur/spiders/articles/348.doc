Can I Get a Little Help Here?

David Macrae is a serial entrepreneur. After successfully growing three
technology companies, he's at it again with Atlanta-based Bulletin.net. With
this new company, Macrae hopes to capitalize on the need for expanded services
from wireless carriers. Bulletin.net's software products enable a range of
wireless devices to provide users with messaging, wireless applications,
e-mail and wireless Internet access, and help integrate future technologies as
they emerge. "The large telecoms are not equipped to develop and deploy these
services to mobile professionals," says Macrae. "But a nimble company such as
ours can." Like McDonald's, Macrae sees billions and billions to be served.

But, as Macrae is the first to admit, "No matter how many times you start a
business, you almost always get to a point where it needs an infusion of
equity capital from outside investors." That also means you'll have to face
one of the greatest entrepreneurial quandaries: Should I try to raise the
money myself, or should I hire a consultant to help me find the capital my
business needs?

Macrae, 49, who has been down both routes before and has learned the ropes, is
going it alone for his new company's $3 million raise. But he cautions,
"Entrepreneurs should seriously consider outside help when it comes to raising
money."

Russell Robb, managing director of Atlantic Capital Management and president
of the Association for Corporate Growth, a trade group for deal-makers, is
less ambivalent on this point. "If you are raising capital for an emerging-
growth business," he says, "in most instances, an outside advisor is the
safest, smartest way to go."
