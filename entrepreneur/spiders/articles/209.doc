Startup Capital for Investors

Raising money has always been a problem for inventors, whether they need funds
for a patent, for a prototype, or for production. You need more money than
ever to cover the high costs of production and to get into the market with as
much momentum as possible. But inventors have an easier time raising money
because of manufacturers and marketers' willingness to help fund new projects,
and because of new security rules established by the SEC. Inventors can also
benefit from community-based funding that rural areas offer to entice
business. Of course, all this doesn't mean raising money is easy. You need a
good plan, a good product and support from potential customers. If you have
these, you'll find that money is available.

That said, don't rush to quit your job. Many inventors use credit cards or
personal loans to fund at least the first phase of their inventions, and these
loans will be hard to get if you are self-employed with no income. Instead,
apply for your loans or credit cards _before_ you quit. You don't want to take
on so much debt that you'll go bankrupt, but it helps to have an extra $5,000
to $10,000 in credit. Also, try to keep working for as long as possible to
maintain your income until you begin making sales.

Now's a good time to take a close look at your business experience. You aren't
going to get money from serious investors unless you have someone on your team
with experience in running a company or launching a product. If you don't have
that experience, get a mentor or a business partner who can give your venture
the business background it needs to succeed.

#### Early Stages

The money you spend early on will help finalize your idea through the
prototype stage. It will also let you make initial contacts with industry
insiders. Here's a rundown of typical costs:

1\. Initial seed money: $100 to $1,000. This money-self-funded through credit
cards, savings or the sale of personal property-is used for a patent search,
initial market analysis and verification of your premise. You might also want
to attend a trade show to check out products and interview industry people.

This will give you a better understanding of your idea's market potential.
Prepare a presentation on why your invention will sell. You'll need it to get
funds from family, friends and industry investors.

2\. Feeling out the market: $200 to $2,000. Attend trade shows and association
meetings to start networking and learning about competitors. You'll use the
presentation developed with seed money to explain your product to industry
contacts and potential investors. After this period, you should have a better
presentation, and you should make a sample brochure. You may need a concept
model for the brochure.

Even if you don't need the money, this is a good time to start adding
investors because you only need to ask them for small amounts. You could ask
for $500 from each of three investors to prepare a concept model and a sample
brochure, and visit two trade shows. Your goal is to line up industry contacts
as early investors you can rely on during your invention process. You may want
to apply for a provisional patent before attending the show so you can say
your product is patent pending.

3\. Models, prototypes and patents: $500 to $20,000, depending on your patent
strategy and the complexity of the prototype. Once you have solid information
that your product has true market potential, you need to make a high-quality
prototype and implement your patent strategy. Now, your goal is to prepare a
product, a brochure and an ad package you can use to conduct the research you
need to land a private-label, joint-venture or license agreement. Consider
your patent strategy carefully, since you're about to research your idea in
the market with end users.

Now's the time to get industry investors and contract manufacturers involved.
That's because they only have to invest a small amount now; later, you'll want
more money, and the easiest investments to get are ones from people who have
already invested. You can also self-fund this stage and get money from family
and friends, but those aren't your best investor options.

4\. Research results: $300 to $6,000, depending on how close you are to the
trade shows and key industry meetings. You have a product, a brochure and an
ad. Now you need to interview end users and people in the distribution channel
to see what they think. Attend trade shows and association meetings to meet as
many industry people as you can to talk about your idea. Some inventors take
out a booth at industry trade shows to gauge customer response.

Your goal is to prove your product can sell so you can get investors,
companies and industry insiders to help fund preparations for production. That
step is expensive, and you'll need investors-probably lots of them. Try to get
as many potential investors as possible to attend research events or trade
shows. They're more likely to invest if they see end users get excited about
the product.

#### Preparing for Production

The work involved in preparing your product for production can seem
intimidating and expensive, but breaking it up step by step will help you get
a handle on the process. Here's a look at the steps and costs involved:

1\. Finalizing the presentation: $1,500 to $4,000, depending on how many
presentations you make and how far you must travel. If you hope to get a
private-label contract or a joint-venture agreement, you'll need a prototype,
an impressive demonstration and research that shows your product can sell. For
this step, you need to prepare a presentation to show to interested parties.

Your best investor here is an industry insider. Having an industry insider on
board implies that the product has strong sales potential. If you are
proposing private-label sales, your contract manufacturer may also be willing
to help fund this step.

2\. Finalizing documentation: $10,000 to $200,000, depending on the complexity
of the product and whether you've hired salespeople to help presell the
product. At this stage, you do the engineering documentation, prepare
preproduction models and presell the product to people in the distribution
channel. This step is necessary but difficult to get money for because it
doesn't do any more to prove the product's sales potential. All you're doing
is getting things ready so they can be manufactured correctly. Your contract
manufacturer may pick up the costs if you've done a good job researching the
market and networking with contacts.

3\. Finalizing the marketing plan: $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the extent
of the plan and how much help you need to finish it. Here, you prepare a
marketing plan for building sales momentum by preselling and quickly
penetrating the market once production starts. You write the plan to be sure
you are doing all you can to presell and market the product, as well as to
create the basis for a business plan, which you may need to get investments to
start production.

Use your industry contacts to write the plan. Try to get the help of a large
potential industry investor. He or she will have great ideas, and helping
write the plan will help persuade him or her to invest in your company.

#### Introducing Your Product

You will have come a long way by the time you hit this stage. Luckily, you'll
be ready for the next few steps. It will cost a lot, but the money you need
can be found from many sources, such as:

  * Private placements: You hire a broker to sell stock. It's similar to a public offering, except that the stock from a private placement isn't listed on an exchange where it can be readily traded.
  * Venture capitalists: These firms invest at least $1 million in companies with high growth potential, experienced management and a sound business plan.
  * Angel investors: Angels can be anyone-your neighbor, people at church or local philanthropists. They're nonprofessional investors who invest to help you get started, though they usually won't know much about your business and rarely want any involvement.
  * Joint-venture financing: You get this from companies that help you manufacture or market your product.

These are just a few examples of the many available funding sources. However
you decide to raise money, you'll most likely be spending it on:

1\. Manufacturing startup: $5,000 to $1 million or more for tooling,
inventory, packaging and all the other materials and equipment needed to
manufacture the product. You need lots of money, and you won't get it unless
you have proven the product will sell.

2\. Marketing introduction: $5,000 to $500,000 or more, depending on the size
of your market. Your expenses include trade shows, advertising and
distribution programs; hiring and training manufacturers, sales reps and
inside salespeople; and creating a Web site. Don't skimp on your marketing
plan, especially if you need lots of money to make your product. Investors
will want a big return, and fast. You want a marketing plan that will produce
quick sales to jump-start the product.

3\. Setting up company operations: $20,000 to $500,000. This includes
operating capital, buying computers, hiring an accountant and paying legal
fees.
