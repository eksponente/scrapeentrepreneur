A Look Into Entrepreneurial Approaches to Social Change

My first experience with the world of startups dates back to the early 1980s,
when I had the privilege of joining the world's first online service, or what
today would be called an "Internet company." One more stop at another startup
effort and I finally had the chance to be part of building the company that
quite literally brought America Online.

We didn't just build a Fortune 500 corporation, we helped usher in the digital
revolution. But I believe our success, in the face of competitors who had
deeper pockets and wider networks, rested on a critical point: We were on a
mission that went beyond making money. The early team at AOL undoubtedly
believed in the power of the Internet to democratize access to ideas,
information and communication _and_ level the playing field. It was that sense
of mission that drove our passion and perseverance.

Fast-forward to today and a new breed of entrepreneur is increasingly on the
rise -- one that is also driven by more than just financial incentive, but by
a desire to change the world. Social entrepreneurs are adapting innovative
solutions to address some of the most pressing societal issues and complex
problems. They are building long lasting, profitable businesses while
addressing issues like education, hunger, financial literacy and much more.
They understand that an entrepreneurial approach and a solid business model
could be key to solving big challenges -- and they're building companies out
of bold and innovative ideas.

## The Rise of the Social Enterprise

As Julius Caesar once told his armies, "Fortune favors the bold." Social
enterprises are thriving across the globe, from Nairobi-based Sanergy, started
by MIT grads who have built and deployed nearly 400 "Fresh Life" toilets in
urban slums while converting waste to energy and fertilizer for thousands, to
Oakland, Calif.-based Revolution Foods, founded by two moms who have
transformed the way kids eat in 1,000 schools across the U.S.

As social entrepreneurship continues to grow, a new opportunity has bloomed
for investors who want to generate both a financial and a social return --
[impact investing](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/impact-investing). Thanks
to pioneering investors and organizations like DBL Investors, Global Impact
Investing Network (GIIN), Rockefeller Foundation, and B Lab who have supported
the development of infrastructure and measurement systems, created
certification programs and invested directly in companies, the impact
investing market is poised to become a mainstream phenomenon.

Emblematic of the kind of momentum we are seeing in the market, in June of
this year nearly 30 corporations, banks, foundations and individuals --
including Prudential, the Omidyar Network and Capricorn Investment Group --
[announced at the White House their joint
commitment](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/06/25/executive-actions-
accelerate-impact-investing-create-jobs-and-strengthen-communities) to invest
more than $1.5 billion into companies and funds that strive to generate
positive financial and social returns. U.S. government agencies, including the
Small Business Administration and the Department of Treasury, also [announced 
programs](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/backgr
ound_on_wh_rountable_on_impact_investing.pdf) to support impact investments
and social enterprises.

The social investing sector has tremendous potential and much of it has yet to
be explored. Over the past two years, we've engaged in hundreds of
conversations with current and potential impact investors to understand both
the opportunities for the space, as well as the hurdles for bringing more
capital into companies and other vehicles that blend profit and purpose. One
of our biggest takeaways is that people simply don't know where to start.
That's why we released ["A Short Guide to Impact
Investing,"](http://casefoundation.org/projects/impact-investing) designed to
help investors better understand ways to capitalize on companies and growing
markets that can deliver both financial and social returns.

In addition, we heard an overwhelming request for more examples of what works
for companies and investors in this space who are developing innovative new
models and approaches. As a result, the [Case
Foundation,](http://casefoundation.org/) in coordination with
[ImpactAlpha,](http://impactalpha.com/) has created a series of profiles on
social entrepreneurs, along with the investors who have backed them, who are
changing the landscape of business for good.

Each week, Entrepreneur.com will publish a profile of entrepreneurs who are
pioneering social change, as well as the investors who are backing their
ambitious efforts.

We are thrilled that _Entrepreneur_ is helping us shine a spotlight on these
stories through this new Impact Profiles series. It is our hope that three
decades from now, we'll be sharing the stories of companies who have
successfully solved our global hunger challenges, closed the opportunity gap,
and supported a new generation of small business owners, all while delivering
positive financial returns, creating jobs and building iconic companies in the
process. They will succeed where others said they could not.
