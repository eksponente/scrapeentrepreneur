What's My Company Worth?

David Lindsay, 38, is the CEO of Confluentia Group, a New York City startup
business analysis consulting firm in the financial services sector. Like the
CEOs of many other young companies, Lindsay wanted to grant stock options to
Confluentia's employees performance incentives and to set a tone for the
company's values. For Lindsay, the decision to grant options to employees was
an easy one. However, making a decision about where to set the exercise price
and how much of the company to give away was a different story.

"It was important to get that tension right between doing the right thing by
employees and senior level staff--in terms of showing integrity, being fair,
and encouraging an entrepreneurial mind-set--while also managing to maintain
an appropriate level of control over the direction of the company and an
equity stake that was in line with the risk I had taken," Lindsay says.

In October 2007, Lindsay found himself asking the all-too-common question that
he couldn't easily answer: What's my company worth?

Determining the value of a growing company is a critical step. It will come
into play not only when granting options to employees, but also when raising
capital from investors, selling assets or buying out a partner.

Value your company too low, and you can give too much of it away. On the other
hand, value your company too high, and you may turn investors away when you're
raising future rounds of capital.

According to Carmel, Indiana independent valuation expert Michael Pellegrino,
the process of determining a company's value is part art and part science.

"The science is in the mathematics: looking at cash flows, revenues and assets
and crunching the numbers," Pellegrino says. "The art is in knowing how to
apply those numbers in a way that is going to be appropriate and credible."

Valuing an early-stage business can be especially difficult. Early-stage
businesses tend to be short on assets or steady cash flow, factors valuation
analysts use to assess value. Without these, early-stage company values are
based more in the art of valuation methodology rather than the science, and
according to Pellegrino, this is where experience becomes critical.

"During the dotcom era, you really began to see that standard methods of
valuation didn't apply to early-stage companies," he says. Investors came up
with new methods for valuation that placed more emphasis on factors like
customer acquisition cost or click-through rates.

But at the end of the day, many of those methodologies churned out estimates
that were imprecise and/or inaccurate. Nevertheless, the calculus was
significantly altered.

"Valuation methods for early-stage businesses can vary widely in philosophy,
and determining an accurate number that can be relied on is sometimes a
problem for management," Pellegrino says.

To complicate matters, valuation can be significantly influenced by other
factors, such as company location or the interests of the parties performing
the analysis. For example, according to Pellegrino, on the West Coast where
there's a culture of "a prayer and the dream," valuations tend to be higher
than on the East Coast, where there is more of a pragmatic investor culture.

The analyst matters, too. A valuation expert may place heavy emphasis on
market adoption of a product or service, whereas a valuation performed by an
institutional investor, like a venture capitalist, may be more heavily
influenced by other factors such as exit strategy and ROI.

Tom Dickerson, a partner in the Greenwich, Connecticut-based VC firm Tullis
Dickerson & Co. Inc., names two factors that drive valuation for his firm: how
much money they need to put in to get to an exit and how much time it takes to
get there. Dickerson, whose fund invests in the health-care sector, points to
shifting exit valuations for biotechnology companies as an example.

"Two years ago, companies were IPOing at valuations of around $250 million.
Now they are going out at $125 million," he says. According to Dickerson, this
has created downward pressure on valuations in this sector since the VCs need
to buy in at a lower valuation to maximize their ROI.

For entrepreneurs, getting valuation correct is critical when raising
investment capital, particularly if a business plan calls for multiple rounds
of financing. If you over-value your company in a friends and family round,
you may turn off future investors completely. And those investors who will
look at your deal may require a lower valuation. Earlier-stage investors will
find it distasteful if investors in later rounds buy in for less money. In
this situation, investors like Dickerson will almost always require existing
stockholders to sign off on the deal, which can be a tricky task for
management.

To complicate matters, management is obliged to make sure that a valuation is
fair and in shareholders' best interests. However, while there is no golden
standard for valuing an early-stage business, the good news is that, legally,
management has broad latitude when it comes to which method to use. In the
event of a dispute with shareholders about valuation, courts generally will
not call into question management's decisions regarding valuation as long as
the assessment was performed on an informed basis using valuation methods that
are acceptable in the company's industry.

While not legally required, engaging the services of an independent valuation
expert may be a good idea, particularly for entrepreneurs with no background
in finance. The expert's report serves as evidence that management met its
standard of care to shareholders.

Ultimately, Lindsay decided against utilizing the services of a valuation
expert.

"Given that Confluentia was just at the inception stage, an expert was going
to do a full analysis on a lot of theoretical items and unknown factors,"
Lindsay says. "I felt that an expert was just going to come up with a model
that they could update in the future but would add little value to us at this
stage."

At the time, Lindsay had just begun actively marketing his services but did
not yet have contracts from which to base a revenue forecast. Additionally,
Confluentia had the capacity to develop software products that could
potentially be licensed to its clients.

"That's a huge X-factor that could have had a material impact on Confluentia's
value but was hard to allocate a number to," Lindsay says.

Lindsay's in good company.

"In certain cases, early-stage companies have few resources, so the idea of
adding another service provider into the mix is not something that many
entrepreneurs are interested in doing," Pellegrino says. "Those are dollars
that could be going toward product development."

Frustrated by the lack of tools that are available to help early-stage
companies attain a realistic valuation, Lindsay relied on his own financial
acumen. He reviewed several sources of relevant criteria, including the prices
at which industry competitors had been sold as compared to their revenues. He
also factored in projected revenues for Confluentia and his likely exit
strategy.

After careful consideration, Lindsay came up with a valuation for Confluentia
that he feels is a good starting place.

Lindsay plans to re-visit valuation when Confluentia hits certain revenue
milestones and is actively pursuing a software concept, which he believes will
be within the next 18 months.
