Can Social Networking Sites Help Your Biz?

Paul Allen, managing partner of business incubator [Infobase
Ventures](http://www.infobaseventures.com/)in Provo, Utah, likes to help
entrepreneurs with advice on business plans and raising capital. But as a
frequent lecturer at business schools and conferences, he recently found
himself inundated with requests. So he made a new rule: If you're not a member
of the LinkedIn network with a minimum of 10 connections and two endorsements
on the site, don't even bother calling him. "The most important thing for an
entrepreneur is not necessarily what they know, but who they know," says
Allen.

Allen's prerequisite underscores the growing popularity--and scope--of online
business networking tools such as Palo Alto, California-based LinkedIn Corp.
These sites allow members to build networks of friends and associates, as well
as gain warm introductions to investors and potential clients. "It's really
automating and streamlining the historic word-of-mouth introduction process,
which tends to be the best source of investment opportunities," says LinkedIn
member Chip Hazard, managing general partner at Boston-based VC firm IDG
Ventures.

#### More Than Money

Beyond just bringing entrepreneurs and investors together in a trusted
context, these virtual communities are helping small businesses find potential
customers, board members and other strategic business partners. Spoke.com, run
by Palo Alto, California-based [Spoke Software](http://www.spoke.com/), helps
small companies with sales prospecting and lead generation. Tim Connors, a
general partner at U.S. Venture Partners who helped found Spoke Software,
realized that the speed with which a small venture could get to a decision-
maker at a prospective company had a direct impact on the company's success.
"We needed to get to companies quickly and understand quickly whether there
was opportunity there," says Connors, 38. The software developed by Spoke
analyzes members' e-mail traffic to assess the strength of relationships with
contacts and bring people closer through those connections.

In addition to hastening introductions, virtual networks are leveling the
field by replacing costly middlemen small businesses can ill afford. Alexander
Muse, co-founder of Dallas-based Hive.media, a production company developing
programming for the nascent high-definition TV market, realized this benefit
when he was shopping his pilot to the networks. He found that reps wanted
anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 upfront, plus 50 percent of the profits from
the sale. "And all they'd really be doing is making introductions," says the
33-year-old executive producer.

Instead, Muse and his partner, Scotch Ryan, 35, joined LinkedIn for free and
found program directors at major cable networks and marketing folks at
advertisers like BMW who have expressed interest in buying into the reality
show, which follows three amateur car enthusiasts racing at 300-acre
MotorSport Ranch. "It looks like those contacts will result in the sale of the
program," Muse says.

Clearly, the value of online networks has grown along with their memberships.
LinkedIn, for one, has been adding 60,000 new members a week, according to
vice president of marketing and co-founder Konstantin Guericke.

Muse observes, however, that the growing pool could hurt entrepreneurs. "I
think, over time, it's going to get less useful because there will be too many
people connecting to too many people, so eventually, we're all connected," he
says. Discriminating users, he adds, could help maintain the value.

Muse also points out, as do VCs, that virtual cocktail parties are not a
replacement for face-to-face contact. "It's a neat tool you can use in
conjunction with your networking," Muse says. "But if you never go to
networking events and just sit in your house and play on LinkedIn, you're not
going to get anywhere. You have to know people for it to have value."
