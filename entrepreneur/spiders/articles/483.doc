Passing The Buck

_Entrepreneur_ magazine, May 1997

Business is great, orders are pouring in, but you lack the cash to meet the
demand and you can't get a loan because you haven't been in business long
enough or don't have collateral. Your solution? Factoring.

One of the oldest forms of business financing, factoring--selling accounts
receivable to a third-party funding source for cash--is the cash-management
tool of choice for many companies.

In a typical factoring arrangement, the client (you) makes a sale, delivers
the product or service and generates an invoice. The factor (the funding
source) buys the right to collect on that invoice by agreeing to pay you the
invoice's face value less a discount--typically 2 percent to 6 percent. The
factor pays 75 percent to 80 percent of the face value immediately and
forwards the remainder (less the discount) when your customer pays.

Because factors extend credit not to their clients but to their clients'
customers, they are more concerned about the customers' ability to pay than
the client's financial status. That means a company with creditworthy
customers may be able to factor even if it can't qualify for a loan.

Once used mostly by large corporations, factoring is becoming more widespread.
Still, plenty of misperceptions about factoring remain.

Factoring is not a loan; it does not create a liability on the balance sheet
or encumber assets. It is the sale of an asset--in this case, the invoice. And
while factoring is considered one of the most expensive forms of financing,
that's not always true. Yes, when you compare the discount rate factors charge
against the interest rate banks charge, factoring costs more. But if you can't
qualify for a loan, it doesn't matter what the interest rate is. Factors also
provide services banks do not: They typically take over a significant portion
of the accounting work for their clients, help with credit checks, and
generate financial reports to let you know where you stand.

The idea that factoring is a last-ditch effort by companies about to go under
is another misperception. Walt Plant, regional manager with Altres Financial,
a national factoring firm based in Salt Lake City, says the opposite is true:
"Most of the businesses we deal with are very much in an upward cycle, going
through extremely rapid growth."

Plant says you may be a candidate for factoring if your company regularly
generates commercial invoices and you could benefit from reducing the time
receivables are outstanding. Factoring may provide the cash you need to fund
growth or to take advantage of early-payment discounts suppliers offer.

Factoring is a short-term solution; most companies factor for two years or
less. Plant says the factor's role is to help clients make the transition to
traditional financing.

Factors are listed in the telephone directory and often advertise in industry
trade publications. Your banker may be able to refer you to a factor. Shop
around for someone who understands your industry, can customize a service
package for you, and has the financial resources you need.
