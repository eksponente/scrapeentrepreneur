What You &lt;i&gt;Really&lt;/i&gt; Need to Know About Startup Financing

When physical therapist Jodi Medell opened a running store in Santa Fe, New
Mexico, she had time on her side. Her home had sold, and as a result, Medell
had a critical ingredient in any start-up financing plan: collateral to secure
a loan, the lack of which can ground even the most inspired idea.

She also found a supporter in a local banker, a fellow runner who thought
Medell's vision was well-suited to the Southwestern town; the nearest such
store was an hour away. "Everything fell into place," recalls Medell, 33. "My
house was on the market for a while. Right before I desperately needed money
for collateral, it sold."

Getting collateral was only half the battle. Although it took just three
months from the time she drafted a business plan until she received an SBA
loan from a local bank, in that short period, Medell learned the harsh reality
of start-up financing. To begin with, she qualified for only two-thirds of her
loan request, despite putting up the money from her home, her car and life
insurance for collateral. She also had the daunting task of developing a
three-year financial plan. Lacking a business background, Medell struggled
with the estimates. "It was phenomenal how much paperwork I had to go
through," she says. "You spend so much energy trying to get funding that
you're wasted before you even open."

The rigors of the credit process didn't end with the launch of her store, [The
Running Hub](http://www.runsantafe.com/). The $98,000 loan was mainly for
inventory, and she needed approval before accessing funds. "I had to copy my
invoices and send them to the bank so they had proof it was going back into
the inventory," says Medell.

Despite the strings attached to her financing, Medell is one of the lucky
ones. While there may seem to be a boundless supply of business credit, little
is flowing to start-ups. Even SBA dollars generally fund existing companies,
not start-ups like Medell's. And other programs for unbankable entrepreneurs
have such strict requirements that many people don't qualify.

Complicating the credit search are misconceptions about start-up financing.
One of the most common myths is that the strength of a business idea can
secure a bank loan when assets are scarce. "My first question is, 'How much do
you have [available] to put in?' I make it clear that I will not be their
venture capital partner," says John Milbauer, chair of Minnesota's [Lino Lakes
State Bank](http://www.linolakesstatebank.com/), which requires an owner's
equity investment of 25 percent of project costs.
