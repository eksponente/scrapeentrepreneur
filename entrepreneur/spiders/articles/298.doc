Big Shots

When the founders of Giving-Capital Inc., a Philadelphia-based company that
provides online donation services, first went shopping for an accounting firm
for tax services in 1999, they had their pick of mid-tier local firms.
Instead, they chose a Big Five firm that could grow with them, provide
networking connections that smaller firms couldn't and, most important, be a
name their clients-including American Express, Morgan Stanley and Salomon
Smith Barney-could trust. Little did they know the large, reputable firm they
chose, Arthur Andersen, would just a few years later find itself waist-deep in
scandal.

Fallout from the debacle has landed GivingCapital in the same unenviable spot
as hundreds of other orphaned Andersen clients. But as a small business with
35 employees, it would now have to jockey alongside much bigger companies for
the attention of the Final Four (as the remaining top-tier accounting firms
have come to be called) and even face competition for mid-tier accounting
firms looking to inherit some of Andersen's heavyweight clients.

"A lot of small businesses are going to be squeezed out of those mid-level
firms, even the fast-growing, progressive companies," says Norman Scarborough,
associate professor of economics and business administration at Presbyterian
College in Clinton, South Carolina.

And as the choices narrow, "your ability to negotiate and get decent pricing
becomes more challenging," says Gretchen Nickel, managing director and CFO at
GivingCapital. "You have to make a choice about whether you're willing to pay
the bucks for the big guys. If you don't [pay up,] you're not going to get
their full attention-go with a smaller firm."

**Going Local**

Some small businesses are opting for the latter, particularly those that don't
require auditing services and need only basic tax and accounting services. The
Phelps Group, a Santa Monica, California-based marketing firm, made the choice
years ago to employ a local firm for all its accounting and has been thrilled
with the level of service, according to Phelps CFO Bob Berry. "When you're
working with big firms, you're probably 10 or 12 layers removed from any of
the principals," he says. By contrast, Berry gets the personal attention of
the head of his accounting firm.

But the Phelps Group isn't public nor is it planning to be in the immediate
future. Conventional wisdom has long warned entrepreneurs who have one eye on
the public markets that an auditing firm whose name packs muscle with Wall
Street is critical to a successful IPO. That thinking has changed somewhat,
given the recent high-profile accounting messes, but the larger firms still
offer broader resources and brand names.

Also, a considerable number of small businesses do voluntary audits, sometimes
for their own internal checks and balances or to give bankers an added level
of confidence to negotiate a better interest rate. GivingCapital has always
done audits to reassure clients and hopes to replace Andersen with another
heavy-hitter, "provided we get some decent pricing," Nickel says. The company
is fortunate in that the teams with whom it worked at Andersen are currently
relocating to other firms, lock, stock and barrel, which may give Nickel a
foot in the door at the new firms. But to persuade a top-tier firm to take on
GivingCapital's business, at a reasonable price, she'll have to prove her firm
is going to grow at a healthy clip. "I'm selling them as much as they're
selling me," she says.

To attract top- or even mid-level firms where no prior relationship exists,
small businesses will have to demonstrate significant growth potential so the
accounting firms see the possibility of doing audits and IPO work for them
later, says Scarborough. He advises CEOs to take a business plan along "and do
a sales job. 'I may be a small company now, but look where we're going.'"

Small businesses that already have relationships at larger or mid-level firms
will have to be careful they don't get short shrift due to an influx of former
Andersen clients. If you start noticing you're getting less attention from the
partner who used to call you personally, "then it's time to be a squeaky
wheel," says Debra Jeter, associate professor of management at the Owen
Graduate School of Management in Nashville.

Another option is to go with a reputable smaller or local outfit that has
relationships with larger firms. That way, if your business grows or you
decide to go public, you have the option of transitioning.

While the Big Five brand names used to be enough to get Wall Street's stamp of
approval, they're not enough anymore. "We've got a whole new world on our
hands," Jeter says. "The quality of the audit is ultimately going to be the
deciding factor."
