Reducing Your Overall Tax Bill

Q: I own my own service business. I have certain financial responsibilities to
my family and my parents. I've been told that there are some tax laws that
would allow me to reduce my taxes, yet still provide financial support to my
family. Is that true, and, if so, how can I do that? Also, I heard that by
hiring independent contractors I can save considerable payroll taxes, as
compared to hiring regular employees. Is this a valid strategy?

A: Tax law allows you to reduce your family's overall income tax liability
(business and personal) by hiring your family to perform work in your
business.

As a small-business owner, you have an opportunity to hire your spouse, your
children and even your parents as a way of minimizing your family's tax
burden. By shifting taxable business income to another family member, you can
move dollars from higher tax rates to lower tax rates-creating real tax
savings for you and your business.

Under age 18 (and at least 7-the IRS has approved that age for employing your
children), your children are exempt from Social Security and Unemployment
Taxes through an unincorporated business.

Pay your children when they perform legitimate work in your business. If you
planned on giving them money anyway, this is a fantastic way to give them
wages that are tax-deductible to your business, tax-free to them (up to the
$4,750 standard deduction), and you still get to claim your children as
dependents on your personal income tax return. For wages in excess of $4,750,
their beginning tax rate is only 10 percent.

Note: Pay your children contemporaneously (not just at year-end) and in the
same manner as other employees-on a regular basis by check.

You can pay your parents wages (for legitimate work) with tax-deductible
dollars from your business. These tax-deductible (before-tax) dollars replace
the after-tax dollars that you otherwise would have given them. Because you
are paying them with your business's before-tax (tax-deductible) dollars,
there are more of these dollars to give them than you otherwise would have had
available for them; this is because after-tax dollars would be less than
before-tax dollars by the amount of tax paid.

When you use independent contractors in your business, document their
independent contractor status carefully. If you hire and pay independent
contractors when they are actually working as employees, your business may be
liable for payroll taxes on these individuals.

The IRS uses specific criteria to determine if an individual is entitled to be
paid as an independent contractor. When you pay independent contractors, you
save your business the cost of payroll taxes, as they are not entitled to
those benefits. Compare that to wage-earning employees, who are entitled to
payroll tax benefits.

You can hire an individual as an independent contractor if he or she meets the
IRS's criteria. The IRS says these factors tend to show a person is an
independent contractor:

  * The worker hires, supervises and pays his or her own employees.
  * The worker is free to work when and for whom he or she wishes.
  * The work is done on the worker's premises.
  * The worker is paid by the job or on a straight commission basis.
  * The worker is at risk of profit or loss.
  * The worker does work for several businesses at one time.
  * The worker's services are available to the general public.
  * The worker can't be fired, except for breach of contract.

Note: You are required to prepare a 1099 (instead of a W-2) if you paid an
independent contractor $600 or more for his or her services during any single
tax year.
