K.I.T.

**Q: We own an insurance agency, and we find we don't need much from our bank now. How do we maintain good relations?**

A: The cold reality: The bank doesn't need you at all. You must take the
initiative to keep in touch. I endorse the following nine-point program:

1\. Keep the lines of communication open with your overworked account officer.
Make an appointment to deliver and briefly review your current business and
personal financial statements. Give him or her a short history of your company
and your current business plan. Be responsible for educating the officer about
your industry. Wait a few months, and invite him or her to lunch. It's
deductible.

2\. Identify shared personal interests or values. Become a good business
acquaintance. In conversation, be candid; never make false claims or
exaggerate. And don't bad-mouth your competition.

3\. Never surprise the banker with bad news. If things are not going well and
it could negatively impact your accounts or loans, give the banker plenty of
warning.

4\. Never break a promise to the banker, not even a trivial one. The primary
risk factor in small-business banking is the credibility and character of the
customer.

5\. Don't be overly aggressive in your accounting choices or in minimizing
income taxes. If you follow nonstandard accounting procedures, the bank can't
compare your financials to industry averages. Banks don't underwrite loans to
companies losing money, even when there's a deliberate tax strategy involved.

6\. Network with the bank to meet your account officer's boss and the person
who pinch-hits when your officer is on vacation. Go to bank-sponsored seminars
and receptions. Learn the names of local bank directors. If you meet them
socially, let them know you are a satisfied customer.

7\. Only refer quality business owners to the banker. You are known by the
company you keep.

8\. Never take the bank for granted by overdrawing accounts or making late
loan payments. Don't ask for unnecessary policy exceptions.

9\. Stay focused on your business, but also seek the benefits of industry
leadership roles.
