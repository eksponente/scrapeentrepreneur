Retire Rich

Retirement is not a word that often rolls off an entrepreneur's lips. Whether
starting a new business or enjoying the benefits of an established one, few
entrepreneurs care to think about their golden years-or anything else that
might separate them from their companies.

Perhaps it's their built-in tolerance for risk, or the success-at-any-cost
passion that entrepreneurs wear on their sleeves, but many seem to want to
work until they hit it _really_ big--or die trying. But that strategy won't
ensure a life of leisure when 38 turns into 83. And it won't provide for your
family--or your funeral--at any age. Like it or not, to retire rich requires
careful planning at every stage of your business. From starting up to selling
out, there are things every entrepreneur should be doing to balance the
inherent risks of owning a business with the inevitable certainties of old age
and death.

####  First, Do No Harm

Carmine Caccavale liquidated every penny of his savings to launch Mount
Vernon, New York-based [GNC Payroll Plus](http://www.gncpayplus.com/) in 2002.
He sold his house. He emptied his retirement savings. He even paid penalties
to cash out his 401(k). "That's probably not the textbook way to start a
business, but that's my approach: I burned the boats," he laughs, comparing
his new venture, which projects $700,000 in 2005 revenue, to the old Viking
battle tradition of victory or death.

But unlike many entrepreneurs, Caccavale, 38, also made sure his family's
financial future was secure. A $2 million life insurance policy and a
disability income policy at least guarantee that, in case of misfortune, his
fledgling business venture won't bankrupt his spouse or prevent his two
daughters from going to college.

The decision to take out life insurance, he says, was based partly on a
tragedy that struck Caccavale's family 30 years ago. Shortly after starting a
new check-cashing business, Caccavale's father was killed in his store in
1976, leaving his family nearly destitute.

Caccavale's use of insurance is a smart move, says Mark Menges, an independent
financial planner in Columbus, Ohio. Menges coaches entrepreneurial clients on
the best ways to build personal wealth. Reducing startup risks through
insurance is one of the first things Menges recommends for early stage
entrepreneurs. But he also says having a Plan B makes good financial sense.
"Don't put every penny you have into the business," he says. "If you have a
downturn or even growing pains in the business, you need the ability to access
money from other sources."

Tom Taulli, an attorney, author and business finance advisor in Newport Coast,
California, says it's hard to overstate the importance of reducing business
risks of all kinds during the startup phase. He suggests purchasing life
insurance policies on each founder and key employee. "For just about every
emerging growth company, there are key employees. If one or more [dies], it
can wreak havoc on a company," he says. "One way to deal with this is to
purchase key-person insurance." In case of tragedy, the insurance plays a dual
role: It pays not only to replace the person, but also to buy the company
stock back from his or her surviving heirs.

Whether through death or simply disagreement, the departure of a partner, key
employee or spouse can derail a startup and threaten the founder with loss of
control. Devising a plan to deal with such issues is best done in the original
documents that create the company, including the shareholder agreement. Within
the contract that each shareholder signs should be a buy-sell agreement that
maps out how a founder can buy back shares of stock from partners, employees
and other shareholders. If you're an early stage entrepreneur like Caccavale,
your business is your most valuable and important personal asset-so
maintaining control is key to retiring rich.

Retirement is still a long way off for Caccavale, but it's already on his
mind. "This money that I'm investing now-I know I'll get it back in spades,"
he predicts. "That's going to be my retirement."
