Dealing With Financial Anxiety

**Q: ** I'm starting a homebased business, and I feel a lot of pressure financially. How do I deal with this anxiety?

**A:** The short answer is: Learn to live with the feeling-you'll feel that way for a long time while starting your business. I don't say that to be flip. It's just true. Every single person starting a business feels that way unless they've recently been left a large inheritance and money is not their primary motivator.

Although the so-called freedoms of self-employment are enticing, with the
benefits of being on your own come a few major downsides. One of those
downsides is financial risk and the volatility of your income. Add to that the
loss of paid benefits, especially if you have a family you're helping to
support, and financial fears are sure to mount.

So the pressure you're feeling doesn't have to signal you're on the wrong
path-it could be a good reality check that shows you what you're up against
and that you aren't being naive. Such pressure can also be what gets you going
in the morning when you'd rather be golfing. I'd be more worried if you were
starting a business and you were so confident, you had no money fears
whatsoever. That's pure arrogance, and if that's how you feel, you're unlikely
to plan for realistic difficulties that most new entrepreneurs encounter.

So to answer your question, How do you deal with the anxiety, directly, here's
my advice:

If you have a spouse, be sure you put together what I call a "family plan,"
which is described in detail in my book, _[Honey, I Want to Start My Own
Business: A Planning Guide for Couples](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/d
etail/-/0788194127/entrepreneurcom)_. Determine the risk you're willing to
take and the level of risk each of you would find intolerable. Stretch to your
limits, but don't go beyond what you can handle (or what your spouse can
handle), or the anxiety will start destroying your productivity-as well as
your marriage.

Often, anxiety comes from exaggerating in our minds what we believe will
happen if we fail. It's the old "bag lady in the street" syndrome. Catch
yourself when your mind spins out of control and confront your worst fears.
What's really the worst thing that could happen? Can you cope with it? How
likely is it to happen? What can you control that will guarantee your worst
nightmare doesn't occur? Could you get financial help from relatives or
elsewhere that would make your greatest fears unlikely? Even if you wouldn't
want to ask, there might be a safety net below that you can count on if you
had to.

Maybe the idea of quitting and going back to a paid job nauseates you. It
won't kill you, though. Remember, that's always an option, as well as moving
into smaller quarters, selling one car or paring down your wardrobe. None of
this may be what you'd want, but you'd survive it.

Most of what we're worried about financially either won't happen or, if it
does, we'll still be OK. Of course, solid business planning and expense-
reduction strategies are in order if self-employment is going to be your
lifestyle. Expect that you won't be profitable for three years, and then
you'll be pleasantly surprised when it's sooner than that rather than panicked
when it takes twice as long as you hoped.

In the meantime, learn how to make the most of the anxiety you wake up with
every day. When you have to summon the self-discipline to stay on track, it
might become your best friend.
