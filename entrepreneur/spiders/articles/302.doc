Offering Debit Payment Options

**Q:** Can accepting debit cards really benefit my business? How do debit transactions work, and what services and equipment do I need to process them?

**A:** Debit cards are a popular payment choice for both merchants and consumers. They are commonly regarded as safer than cash, more convenient than checks and less expensive than credit cards. And thanks to the introduction of offline cards, debit payments are now more prevalent than ever. According to data compiled by _ATM & Debit News_, transactions made with offline debit cards alone during the first nine months of 2001 totaled $4.8 billion, up 26.3 percent from $3.8 billion during the same period in 2000.

Consumers value their debit cards because this payment option quickly and
securely moves checking account funds without the hassles or risks involved
with paper checks. Security features such as personal identification numbers
(PINs) also protect shoppers against theft and fraud. Perhaps most important,
consumers who make debit card purchases are free of the finance charges
associated with credit cards.

Debit cards benefit merchants, too. Notably, a debit transaction can only be
completed if sufficient funds are available in the customer's account, so the
merchant's payment on an authorized transaction is virtually assured. Debit
acceptance also helps merchants by boosting revenue from impulse purchases,
lowering the risk of employee theft and offering access to customers who do
not have or use credit cards. These customers prefer debit cards because they
act virtually the same as cash, only with much more security. In addition,
supermarkets offer "cash back" on debit cards so that they can reduce the
quantity of cash on hand. Handling large quantities of cash is not only risky
due to theft, but also expensive. Someone has to count it, lock it up, recount
it, bring it to the bank, etc.

Two types of debit transaction occur: online and offline. Online debit
payments require the secure entry of a PIN at the point of sale. It is
important to note that this type of debit transaction is only available in the
physical world, as no operating standards have yet been established for
securely processing PINs over the Internet. However, new industry initiatives
are expected to advance the development of PIN-based debit programs for the
Web.

A shopper can initiate an online debit payment in a brick-and-mortar store by
swiping his or her debit card through a magnetic card reader. The customer
must then key his or her secret code into an encryption device called a PIN
pad. The transaction is authorized in real time, funds in the customer's
account are captured immediately, and money is transferred into the store
owner's account in two to three business days. The merchant pays a nominal
transaction fee. And because the customer authorizes payment with a PIN, the
risk of a chargeback is virtually nonexistent.

To accept online debit payments, you must have a merchant account, debit
processing service, a payment terminal, a receipt printer and a PIN pad. Many
payment processing companies offer both credit and debit card services, but
you must be approved for them separately. You can obtain a terminal and
printer with an integrated PIN pad or purchase a discrete PIN-entry device and
connect it to your payment system--just remember that your customers must be
able access the device and enter their codes in private.

Unlike online debit transactions, offline debit payments do not involve PINs.
Offline debit cards (also known as check cards) are typically issued by credit
card companies through their participating banks. U.S. consumers make the
majority of their offline debit purchases with the Visa Check Card or
MasterCard's MasterMoney card. These enhanced ATM cards carry the Visa and
MasterCard logos, respectively, and may be used everywhere the credit cards
are accepted, including over the Internet.

A customer who chooses to make an offline debit purchase in the physical world
authorizes the merchant to charge his or her account. On the Web, the customer
enters check card information into a browser-based form, just as he or she
would with a credit card. The data is encrypted, captured by the transaction
processor's secure payment gateway, and sent to the credit card processing
networks for authorization. Transactions normally settle in two to three
business days.

Because check card transactions are processed through the same networks as
credit cards, they often incur the same discount and transaction fees. If your
business is already equipped to process credit card transactions (i.e., you
have a merchant account, credit card processing service, and either a terminal
and printer or payment-processing software), you should also be able to
process offline debit payments. In fact, you may be accepting them now and not
even know it.

To find out how debit acceptance can benefit your business, contact a payment
service provider with experience in debit processing. A well-established
transaction processor that offers a comprehensive line of payment products,
quality customer service and a solid fraud-protection plan can save you time
and money by offering reliable solutions as well as ongoing merchant support.
