Choosing Between Debt and Equity Financing

Need some practical advice about whether you should use debt or equity
financing during the startup stage? Here are a few tips to help you choose the
best source for your business.

When it comes to the financing popularity contest, equity funding is currently
in vogue. Articles in the mainstream media about venture capital have
glamorized the concept of selling stock in your startup, and entrepreneurs
across the board would much prefer to raise money in the form of equity rather
than debt.

Why is equity so appealing? Because it feels like you're getting "free" money
during the startup stage. There are usually no repayment obligations and no
interest payments due to equity investors. You'll also have some say in
negotiating the price of your stock, any dividend payments and the position
the investor will have in your company. If your business goes belly-up, it's
their loss (unless, of course, your investors can prove in court that you
didn't disclose critical information that would have influenced their decision
to invest).

Besides providing funding, equity investors can be helpful in other ways as
well. They bring their business experience and lessons learned to bear on your
company, and they can become a trusted advisor, mentor or board member. The
best equity investors are those with expertise in your industry, experience
launching a business, a cool temperament and deep pockets. Some say choosing
an equity investor is like getting married--you're making yourself accountable
to this person through thick and thin, so choose carefully.

Before you go investor shopping, though, you should carefully think about just
what you're selling and what having equity investors really means for you and
your business. Very few businesses will ever be able to deliver a decent
return on investment (ROI) for equity investors. The typical restaurant or
retail store, for example, is unlikely to have any liquidity for its shares.
And even if you plan to have a high-growth tech business, the chance of
reaching liquidity for your early investors is low. You must be honest with
yourself about whether your investors expect to be paid back.

Assuming you won't have a glamorous initial public offering, you'll need to
find a way to allow your investors a graceful exit. One option is to find a
new wave of investors willing to buy out the old ones at a share price that
feels like a win-win for all. Another option for investors--especially friends
and family who want to stay involved--is to convert equity positions into
loans. In my role as president of CircleLending, I've encountered these loan
conversions quite frequently, even though equity investors typically have no
legal recourse in the event the business fails. This is one of hidden secrets
of startup financing--that equity investments from relatives, friends and
other startup investors often morph into loans if the businesses fail.

But what about good, old-fashioned loans? If the sheen of equity capital is
tarnished by the reality of having to generate a respectable ROI, you can fall
back on the old familiar friend: a loan. The good news about debt financing is
that you're still completely in charge of your business--your only duty to
your lender is to make your payments on time, as spelled out in your
promissory note. As long as you do that, your lender has no right to meddle in
your business. Interest payments are typically a deductible business expense,
and if your lender is someone you know well, you may be able to get favorable
repayment terms that can make the loan walk and talk much like an equity
investment.

There are several ways to create this flexibility:

  * **Defer the start date of repayment by adding a "grace period."** Startup loans often have a six- to 12-month grace period before repayment starts, providing entrepreneurs with some time to ramp up the business.
  * **Capitalize interest.** Your lender can also capitalize the deferred payments so they don't lose interest funds during the grace period. This allows you to pitch a lender by suggesting a much longer grace period (if you think you'll need more than 12 months).
  * **Use interest-only payments.** If your lender wants to be repaid immediately, offer to make interest-only payments for a period of time to keep your monthly budget in check.
  * **Institute graduated payments.** You can create a unique repayment schedule with low payments at the start of the loan and higher payments at the end when your business is proven.

For lenders who are very cautious about making a loan, you can offer to
provide collateral on the loan, such as a lien on your car or home equity. Be
careful, though: If your business isn't yet well established, taking on this
type of risk too early could be a bad move.

Another solution that some entrepreneurs have used to find a happy middle
ground between debt and equity financing is convertible debt, which is simply
debt that converts to equity as the business grows. Next month, I'll go into
detail on this financing option, so look for my column in May.
