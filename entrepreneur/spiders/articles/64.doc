Small is Bigger Than Ever

While netbook popularity among consumers remains questionable, small
businesses are eating them up, according to market research firm
[Techaisle](http://www.techaisle.com/). Firms with fewer than 10 employees
have been among the biggest buyers, with companies of between 20 and 99
employees (so-called large small businesses, the jumbo shrimp of the business
world) expected to account for more of the future netbook spending at a time
when PC buying becomes the most important small-business expense activity,
Techaisle says. But, don't fall too deeply in love with your little netbook--
tablet PCs, smartbooks and ultralow voltage PCs will challenge the netbook as
the de rigueur power tool in 2010.
