10 Critical Tax Time Considerations

Is your business ready for tax season? While you may only have to file income
taxes once a year, it's something you should be thinking about year round.
Many business decisions you make will have tax implications and knowing those
ahead of time can save you a lot of money.

You should be visiting your tax person at least quarterly, as well as any time
you're making a major decision. Consider them part of your strategic team that
helps you make the best decisions possible.

Here are 10 things you should be discussing during the year to reduce your
liabilities--and stress--when tax time rolls around.

1\. **Change in type of business entity.** Tell your tax person if you've
changed your business formation--sole proprietorship, Limited Liability
Company, corporation, etc.--in any way.

2\. **Fixed asset changes.** Did you buy, trade or sell any of your fixed
assets such as property, plants, equipment or vehicles? If so, provide your
tax accountant with the dates and dollar amounts of all related transactions.
This could affect your tax liability because of depreciation.

3\. **Use of subcontracted services.** If you paid an outside subcontractor
more than $600 in a calendar year and the subcontractor is unincorporated, you
will need to supply a 1099 form. It should be postmarked no later than January
31 of the following calendar year.

4\. **Changes in employee status.** Hiring employees means additional items to
file. Tell your tax person whether you're handling payroll in-house or
outsourcing it. Also, make sure your W-2s are completed by January 31.

5\. **Equipment leases.** The two different types of leases available--
operating and capital-- require different handling for tax purposes. Capital
leases typically are longer term and sometimes end with the lessee taking
ownership of the equipment.

6\. **Withdrawals from the company.** As business owners, we typically take
our compensation in the form of payroll and owner's equity withdrawals. For
tax purposes, these should be kept separate and classified appropriately.
Payroll is classified as an expense, but withdrawals are considered an equity
reduction.

7\. **Personal investments into the company.** If you've made investments into
the business, make sure they aren't classified as income so that you don't pay
taxes on them. They should instead be classified as an increase in owner's
equity investment.

8\. **Loan payment structure.** Are your loan payments broken out into
principal reductions and interest expense? Separate each payment and record
the interest expense on your profit and loss statement and update the loan
principal amount on your balance sheet.

9\. **Mileage.** If you're using personal vehicles for business purposes, give
your tax accountant a log of your mileage so you can take the appropriate
deduction.

10\. **Documentation.** Once you have prepared your data for your tax
accountant, keep your documentation for the appropriate length of time in case
of an audit.

While tax time can seem like a lot of work, it doesn't have to be if you're
maintaining your records throughout the year and consulting your tax person
for proactive advice. After all, your accountant can't provide you with the
best possible service if you only call once a year.

And smart tax strategies like these not only keep you organized, but they can
also help you significantly reduce your company's tax liability. So,
regardless of how far off April 15 may seem, keep these 10 potentially money-
saving factors in mind.
