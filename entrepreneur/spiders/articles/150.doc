There's Lots of Free Help for Choosing and Funding the Right Franchise Opportunity

As an avid researcher of out-of-the box funding and resources, I rarely find a
company that has set the bar so high that it’s hard to look at any other
competitors. Then, last month at the [National Small Business Development
Center Conference](http://www.americassbdc.org/conference/), I attended a
workshop taught by John Blair, the marketing director for
[Frannet](http://www.frannet.com), a franchise-consulting firm with more than
55 offices nationwide.

Frannet provides, absolutely free, tools, resources and advice for eager
franchisee wannabes. If you are considering franchising, connect with this

Development
Centers](http://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/osbdc/resources/11409) (SBDC)
Program, a program administered through the [U.S. Small Business

initiative, entrepreneurs can connect with one of 900 SBDC offices nationwide
to get access to the Frannet advising and guidance, completely free. In
addition, the company offers free [online franchise
seminars](http://www.frannet.com/events) that cover various topics.

## Free personal franchise assessment report

[Frannet ](http://www.frannet.com)has developed a Personal Franchise
Assessment (PFA) tool that provides prospective owners insight into their
goals, skills set and lifestyle so the potential franchisee can be matched
with the correct franchise opportunity. The assessment is categorized into
four key indicators: achiever, emulator, belonger and societal. I completed
the PFA assessment and was impressed that it aligned with my personality,
suggesting several types of franchise businesses based on my personality and
interests.

## Funding options for prospective franchisees

One of the most popular program means to fund a business or recapitalize an
existing business without paying taxes or penalties on the transaction is
through the rollover for business start-up program (ROBS). Essentially, the
individual is investing in themselves and their future by buying stock in
their own company.

A very high percentage of businesses under $200,000 are funded in this way. It
is also used frequently as the equity injection for an[
SBA](http://www.sba.gov) or conventional loan. One of the advantages of this
plan is it's not based on the individual's credit score. It’s important to
understand that the individual is not borrowing against their 401(k). The new
retirement plan has simply invested in the franchise business instead of
investing in another company’s stocks or bonds.

## Tax credits for veterans starting franchises

[The International Franchise Association](http://www.franchise.org) (IFA), in
cooperation with several organizations, created the[ VetFran
program](http://www.vetfran.com) for franchise companies to offer financial
incentives, training and mentoring for veterans interested in starting their
own franchise business. As part of this initiative, there is an effort to
support "Operation Enduring Opportunity," a campaign to recruit and hire as
franchise owners 75,000 veterans and 5,000 wounded warriors.

In addition, there is also the Help Veterans Own Franchising Act (HVOF) that
establishes a tax credit for veterans to become franchise owners and allows a
tax credit of up to 25 percent of the franchise fee to offset start-up costs.
For example, 7-Eleven offers qualified veterans a 20 percent discount off the
franchise fee, along with up to 65 percent financing of the franchise fee.
Based on the [VetFran](http://www.vetfran.com) progress report in 2013 there
were 5,192 veteran franchise business owners.

Choosing a franchise is hard enough. Don't do it alone!
