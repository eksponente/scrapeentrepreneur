On The Spot

What do lenders and investors look at before signing a check over to a
business? Banks want to know if you'll be able to repay the loan, private
investors want to know if they're going to profit, and venture capitalists
want to know if your concept will solve a recognized, widespread problem.

Not that many start-ups have to answer questions from venture capital firms.
"Most [venture capitalists] focus only on two kinds of deals: medical and
high-tech," says Richard Quis, director of marketing and communications for
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

That leaves banks and investors. While banks are usually conservative when it
comes to business loans--particularly to start-ups--more and more are lending
to small businesses. "[Some banks] will make 60 percent to 80 percent loans if
the entrepreneur contributes the other 40 percent to 20 percent of the
equity," says Quis. "However, they discount your assets knowing that if
ownership of the business reverts to them, they'll probably have to discount
the value by 40 percent, and they don't want to suffer a loss." Such funding
from banks, though, is almost exclusively limited to businesses with tangible
assets or substantial receivables.

What about private investors? "They want to know you have enough working
capital to see you through a potentially long, dry start-up period, and a
business plan showing how and why you'll produce sufficient working capital
and profits thereafter," Quis says.

"Be prepared with market studies supporting your concept," he adds. "But such
studies should be conducted by an outside firm. And if you're going into a
retail location, don't touch the deal without input from a site-selection
expert. Then get the report in writing and present it to potential investors."

In your search for funds, Quis suggests, "Keep in mind, investors' interests
are the same as yours: You both want a profitable operation. So provide a
marketing survey, location study, demographic analysis--whatever it takes--and
stress your expertise in the business. That's a major consideration among
investors and lenders alike."
