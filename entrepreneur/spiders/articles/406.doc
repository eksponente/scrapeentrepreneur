Hire On First-Class Employees

Having both worked for midsize to large companies before founding their own
branding design agency, brothers David and Philippe Becker already knew that
great benefits attract top talent. But the basic, no-frills 401(k) they'd
chosen wasn't terribly exciting to employees at Philippe Becker Design; the
investment options were too limited, says David. And they weren't offering a
match because they didn't understand enough about their potential exposure.
Unsure of how to educate employees about their benefits, David, 44, and
Philippe, 41, couldn't seem to attract enough employee participation to make
it worthwhile.

A year ago, they decided to switch to a John Hancock 401(k) that could be
customized by a local third-party administrator. They hired a financial
advisor to help them sort through investment options and select an appropriate
plan for their employee demographic. "He helped us understand not only the
market and what products were out there, but also impending legislation and
what sorts of products our employees could take advantage of," says David,
noting that the new plan is nearing 100 percent participation.

The do-it-yourself 401(k), highly touted in the '90s as the solution for
thrifty, overburdened entrepreneurs, isn't necessarily so. "It sounds good,
but [entrepreneurs who offer them on their own] don't have any outside
guidance, and neither do participants," says Fred Barstein, founder of
401kExchange, an independent advisory firm for retirement plan providers.
Entrepreneurs have the least amount of time to research investment options, he
adds. "The employer is not going to be in a position--nor do they want to be
in a position--to give financial advice, because if they do, they're at risk."

In response to customers' requests for flexibility and advice, retirement plan
providers that previously offered only bundled, all-in-one solutions have
started opening their platforms to third-party administrators--local pension
experts that can tailor plans to fit companies' needs. Transamerica Retirement
Services lets small businesses choose between bundled solutions and a la carte
options through a third-party administrator that can customize the product. It
recently entered partnerships with Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch to broaden
distribution channels and give small businesses better access to retirement
products. "When it comes to retirement plans, we've found that [entrepreneurs]
like to do business with people they're already doing business with," says
Catherine Collinson, senior vice president at Transamerica.

While unbundled solutions usually come with more upfront costs, a third-party
administrator can save a business money by customizing its plan, says Scott
Feit, partner with Abar Pension Services, a third-party administrator. A small
business recently came to Abar with a pre-designed plan. "We did a totally
different one and we were able to get the owners the same contribution and
save them $20,000 to $30,000 [in pension costs]." For the most part, prices
for 401(k) plans have come down in recent years, says Barstein, thanks to new
technology that allows providers to offer information less expensively online
and therefore lower their own costs.

David says the company's new plan did cost more, but that the additional
expense was worth it. "We have to have world-class benefits because we're
competing against world-class companies. All we hear about is how great the
benefits are at Google," he says. "So we'd better keep up."
