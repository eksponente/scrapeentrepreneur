Latest Version of Firefox Is Here

[Mozilla's](http://www.mozilla.com/) upstart open source web browser Firefox
heads for a big milestone with the release of Firefox 2.0. We put the beta
through its paces to see what changes are in store.

On the surface, Firefox 2.0 looks very much like earlier versions, with most
improvements happening behind the scenes. For example, 2.0 introduces a built-
in spell-checker for web forms. That's a boon for forum posters and online
e-mail users.

An anti-phishing filter alerts users to sites that may be scams by comparing
them with a blacklist of phishing sites. A session restore function lets users
recover their pages and tabs after a crash. Firefox 2.0 scores well for its
friendly interface, fast page load times, and improved tabbed browsing and
search engine management. There are also a host of security improvements and
bug fixes. Firefox fans will appreciate the subtle but extremely functional
upgrades.
