Bridge the Gap

Novazone Inc. was not a thriving business when Paul White joined it in late
2003. In fact, the company had cash-flow problems that threatened to quash the
launch of its new ozone-sterilization devices. To buy the business and turn it
around, White needed substantial capital resources.

He also needed investors who could see past the present situation and buy into
his vision of Novazone as a world-class supplier of high-end industrial
equipment.

"Novazone had customers like Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola, Colgate-Palmolive
and Neutrogena," says White, 43, now president and CEO. "But the company was
perpetually running out of money."

The risks were enormous when he offered to buy the struggling company, but so
was the upside potential. White bought the company at a relatively low price
but had to convince investors that it was worth much more. "What we did was
fairly complex," admits White, who jumped into entrepreneurship after several
years as a venture capitalist for Fremont Ventures in San Francisco.

To get money in the door quickly, White offered a series of convertible bridge
loans to angel investors. These loans allowed White to purchase the company
without giving up any ownership until the company's health improved. In other
words, White borrowed money from investors with the promise to convert it into
company stock at a later-determined price. The loan arrangement bridged the
gap between when White needed the cash and when he could reposition the
company with stronger sales and a higher valuation.

####  Right on Time

For entrepreneurs, a key benefit of bridge financing is the time it buys
between investment and valuation, according to Peter Townshend, a partner at
law firm [Allen Matkins Leck Gamble & Mallory
LLP](http://www.allenmatkins.com) in Del Mar Heights, California. Townshend,
who specializes in preparing the legal documents companies need when they
bring on new investors, says he has been preparing more bridge loans lately.

The purpose of the loan is to get a little bit of money in when it's needed
most. That money typically comes from smaller investors, such as angels.
"Entrepreneurs will try to get money in quickly from supportive parties who
might not have enough money to make a round," says Townshend.

He also likes the flexibility of convertible bridge loans. "For a company
that's not in the position to raise bank debt, there hasn't been much between
a bank loan and pure equity capital," Townshend says. In his opinion, the
convertible note is the perfect middle ground: "It's quick to close and can be
as easy as a single loan document."

The loans are short term--typically six months to two years, according to
Townshend, and by definition are meant to be converted into stock rather than
repaid.

####  Rewarding Investor Risk

If this sounds like the answer to your financing prayers, be warned: Bridge
loans make some investors queasy. "For the investor, it's a little like buying
a car without knowing how much it costs," Townshend explains. To overcome
investors' apprehension, companies typically make it very attractive for
investors to take that additional risk. Terms on bridge loans can include not
just interest, but also "warrant coverage"--essentially a free grant of stock
options that can be exercised later.

"[Investors want to] earn a little interest on their loans-maybe 5 percent--
but they'll also earn a discount on the eventual stock purchase. Or they'll
get additional warrants--maybe 25 percent warrant coverage," Townshend says.
That would give a $100,000 investor the option to purchase another $25,000
worth of stock at the same discounted price, but at a later time--perhaps as
much as five years later. At Novazone, early investors who entered into
convertible notes were treated to interest, warrants and a discount on the
eventual stock price. All in all, individual investors lent the company more
than $3 million--enough for White to buy the company, with plenty left over
for working capital and new marketing efforts.

Sales started pouring in immediately. By the third quarter, Novazone's sales
pipeline had grown 250 percent. By late 2004, Novazone was profitable, with
annual sales approaching $10 million.

####  The Conversion

As White had hoped, Novazone's rapid growth began to attract the attention of
venture firms, which led to a large VC investment and the conversion of the
loans into stock within the year.

"That was the tricky part," White recalls. When a VC firm started to negotiate
a major investment into Novazone, some of the original terms of the bridge
loan were called into question. The firm complained that White had given up
too much to the loan holders. Fortunately, those loan holders knew what a
great deal they were getting and were willing to compromise. "There was a lot
of room for renegotiation," says White. "In the end, everybody took a cut--the
note-holders included. But they all bought into the idea that it was the right
thing for the company."

On paper, the original investors (that is, lenders) were rewarded with
exceptional returns on their money. "It was only on paper--a conversion
return," says White, "but it was unanimous that it was a good deal for the
angel investors."

####  The Right Fit

Who should make use of convertible bridge notes? Entrepreneurs who are raising
money from less sophisticated investors should certainly consider it, says
Townshend. "It's perfect for the rich uncle who has no idea what the right
price is for equity. He wants to put money in now and leave the negotiations
to a more sophisticated investor."

Although it is rare for institutions to use bridge notes, the process is so
straightforward that Townshend expects even professional investors to begin
using them more in the future. "Eventually, bridge rounds may replace equity
rounds completely," he predicts.

That would certainly be welcome news for entrepreneurs. Convertible bridge
loans make very good sense for entrepreneurs who can do a lot with a little:
When the initial money can be used, as in Novazone's case, to rapidly improve
a company's position or value, the entrepreneur stands to benefit from a
higher valuation for the company.

The best part? Bridge loans are relatively simple documents. While you'll
still want an attorney involved in drafting the document, taking money through
a bridge note is not nearly as complicated as selling stock in the company.

Nonetheless, Townshend warns entrepreneurs not to use convertible notes
indiscriminately. Company owners should not mislead bridge investors about the
company's plans to raise additional money and convert the loan to stock.
Convertible bridges should only be used when a major financial event--like a
larger round of equity fund raising--is on the horizon.

As Townshend puts it, "The trick is not to let your bridge turn into a pier."
