You Can Rebuild It

When business slows, entrepreneurs often take off their marketer's hat and put
on their accountant's hat. My rich dad often said, "The problem with
accountants running a business is that they forget where their paychecks come
from."  
  
That was my rich dad's way of saying, "Our paychecks come from our customers."
For years, I have been encouraging readers to keep promoting rather than
cutting back--especially in a tough economy. In other words, when putting on
your marketer's hat, keep talking to your customers; don't hide from them.  


Great Business Transformation

  
**iPod:** Firmly planted Apple in the music distribution business  
  
**Tupperware:** Gave an extra "burp" to food storage (and direct selling)  
  
**Prius:** Its mass appeal made Toyota's competitors green with envy  
  
**Scotch Tape:** Made 3M the clear choice for everyday adhesives  
  
**Keds Sneakers:** Turned U.S. Rubber into a footwear trendsetter (in 1916)

Recently, the Rich Dad Company has hired more people for our marketing
department and increased spending on PR, advertising and promoting. I am happy
to say that our income is increasing, which is covering our overhead and
marketing expenses.  
  
On top of increasing our marketing efforts and resources, we have been
redesigning our business. We started this process by redefining our customer
and then redesigning the business to better serve and reach this newly defined
customer. It has not been easy. It has been much more expensive than simply
hiring more people and buying more advertising. Buying advertising is easy.
Redesigning a company is hard.  
  
Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. Let's say I have a Ford
Model T. Simply spending money on new paint, new tires and high-octane gas
will not turn the Model T into an Indy car. The Model T may need to be melted
down and reborn as a race car. This is what The Rich Dad Company has been
doing for the past two years. If we �hadn't melted down the company, we
wouldn't be keeping up with our customers. Simply spending more on advertising
would not have helped.  
  
Unlike an old car, melting down our business is not a �physical process, but a
mental one. Before we could upgrade our thinking, we had to melt down old
ideas and old ways of doing things. Melting down an old car is a lot easier
than melting down an old business and old thinking.  
  
As a young Marine Corps officer, the following mantra was drilled into my
head: "There are no bad soldiers. There are only bad officers." Reminded of
this mantra, I realized that if my company was to change, first, I had to
change. So the melting down began with me. There were three evaluations that
I, personally, had to go through as I asked my company to change. They were:

  1. **What am I afraid of doing?**
  2. **What am I not saying?**
  3. **What can I do to better serve my customer?**

On weekends, I would sit and write down my thoughts to these questions.
Sometimes I got through the process in less than half an hour. Sometimes I was
engaged in these questions all day or longer. The good news is, over time, I
slowly found my actions in the company changing. And once I began to change,
the company changed.
