Dipping Into Your Retirement Fund to Start a Business

**Q:** I am thinking about starting a business, but I need a certain amount of cash on hand to launch my idea. I have a good sum of money in a 401(k) plan with a company I no longer work for, so I was wondering if I should pull the money out of the 401(k) plan to help me finance the startup costs?

**A:** Absolutely not. Don't do it! Take out a small-business loan, raise money from investors, take out a home-equity loan or (I never thought I'd write these words) even go into business with family and friends before liquidating your 401(k). That way, you might lose your friends, family and business associates, but you'll still have your future.

Actually, this is a really tough question. Pretend you're a banker and are
lending yourself money from your 401(k) retirement account. Should you make
that loan? The 401(k) account is currently earning a return on the money
initially invested in it. It's compounding tax-deferred, giving an effectively
higher rate of return, and that tax-deferred effect is permanent. For example,
if the 401(k) is earning 7 percent tax-deferred, and you're in the 25 percent
tax bracket, that's equivalent to earning 9.33 percent in a taxable account.

You (as a banker) should only invest in your entrepreneurial venture if, as
the business owner, you're able to offer a better rate of return on the money.
So don't loan yourself money from your 401(k) unless you can repay at 9.33
percent interest. And remember: Right now, your 401(k) is probably invested in
fairly conservative places. Investing in an entrepreneur, no matter how well
you know him or her, is going to be a lot riskier.

Of course, from the other side, as an entrepreneur you should only borrow
money from your 401(k) if that's the cheapest money available. If you have to
pay yourself back at a return of 9.33 percent, you may be able to find cheaper
money through a home-equity or small-business loan.

####  Consider the Cash Flow

What if you don't care about rate of return? After all, if you own your own
business, you can just live off the business income for the rest of your life.
If that's what you're thinking, run the numbers and make sure. When you retire
with a 401(k), you'll take out living money each year. Make sure your business
can pay you a salary of the same amount. And unless you personally will run
the business until you drop dead, make sure the business can still pay you a
salary even if you have to hire someone else to run it.

Here's a simplified example: You need the business to throw off enough
inflation-adjusted dollars to cover your living expenses plus savings or
retirement expenses. Let's say that 20 years from now, you believe you'll need
$100,000 after taxes to live on. (Remember: 25 years from now, $100,000 may be
peanuts.) If your industry averages a 9 percent margin, that means the
business needs to bring in $100,000/.09 = $1,111,111 per year just to cover
your salary.

####  Look at the Downside

Let's be hard-nosed realists: The small-business failure rate is astounding.
According to [BizMiner.com](http://www.bizminer.com), which tracks industry
statistics, the overall failure rate of businesses started in 2001 is around
37 percent. (It varies by industry, of course.) That's more than one in three.
Your 401(k) is your retirement safety net. Do you really want to use it to
gamble on one-in-three odds?

The baby boomers begin retiring in 2011. As the biggest generation in history,
they'll be turning from net contributors to net drains on the economy. Sounds
like an attractive world. If you bet your 401(k) and lose, what will you fall
back on? The Social Security gap is huge and growing. Americans increasingly
vote for tax breaks, thus cutting social assistance, and medical costs (which
you'll have) rise much faster than inflation. If you believe there won't be a
social safety net for you, consider carefully. You can't put money back into a
401(k) at will, so you'll have to rebuild your tax-deferred nest egg from the
ground up. If you're younger, you can take the risk and still have time to
build another nest egg. But if you're 50, you're risking much more.

####  Certainty Matters

Now it's true that some people have taken huge risks and won. You may decide
to throw caution to the wind, charge up all your credit cards, liquidate
everything and just go for it. Scott Cook was several hundred thousand dollars
in debt at one point during Intuit's life, and now he's worth hundreds of
millions. But we only know his name because he succeeded. We never hear about
the people who take the risk, lose and go bankrupt.

As you may have figured out, I'm fiscally conservative. I've learned from
experience that startups are risky ventures. My retirement money is separate
from the rest of my life and will never be touched for high-risk ventures.
Your situation may be different, however. You may love risk. You may expect to
die young. Or you may have a truly astounding idea that's worth the risk.
Though I hope I've given you a few different ways to think about the issue,
your smartest move will be to find a financial planner who can help you think
through all the implications of your unique decision.
