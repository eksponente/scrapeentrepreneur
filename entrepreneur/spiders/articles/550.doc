The Best Things in Life are Free

**Web design software: free  
Online marketing campaign: free  
Long-Distance calling: free  
Running your small business for next to nothing: priceless.**

Over the decades--heck, even centuries--philosophers, politicians, tycoons and
other leaders have insisted that you can't get something for nothing: "There's
no such thing as a free ride," or "Nothing in life is free." Well-known
economist Milton Friedman once said, "There's no such thing as a free lunch."
Even _Entrepreneur_ columnist Robert Kiyosaki's rich dad told him the same
thing.

But in our evolving Web 2.0 world and with Google leading the way, the rules
have changed: You can get something for nothing--and for entrepreneurs, that
something can have a significant impact on their businesses. Today, the web is
full of free tools to help entrepreneurs start, run and grow their businesses
for next to nothing. It'll just cost you some time and an internet connection.

On using free stuff

• Just because it's there doesn't mean you have to use it. "Because there's so
much out there, businesses have a tendency to be like a kid in a candy store,"
says Drew McLellan. "Start with the strategy of what you want to accomplish,
and then find the tool that will allow you to do that."  
  
Adds Mike Whaling, "It's a matter of figuring out which tools are right for
your business. Know your audience, and then go to where they are already
having conversations."  
  
  • You don't have to figure it all out by yourself. McLellan suggests doing a
simple Google search on a tool or task you want to accomplish. "You'll find
people talking about it," he says. "And people are incredibly quick to share
what they know."  
  
  • Don't lose your company's brand. Using a variety of tools can lead to an
inconsistent company image and voice. Says McLellan, "Run it through the
litmus test of 'Is this right for my business? Does it portray my business the
way I want?'" Whaling also emphasizes thinking about what your business's name
will be associated with because many free tools are ad-supported.  
  
 • Push your preconceived notions aside. MySpace and Facebook aren't just for
the kiddies anymore. Says McLellan, "There are a lot of people conducting
business on [these sites]."  
  
 • Does the tool have staying power? For every successful blog, video website
or social network, there are dozens that won't make it. So, again, talk with
people online and discuss their experiences with the tool to gauge its
stability and reliability.  
  
 • It may be free, but you still need to invest. Just creating a profile won't
cut it. Making the most of these tools requires time and effort, says Whaling.
"There's an investment in reading other people's blogs, commenting on posts,
getting involved in the community and building relationships."  

Gary Vaynerchuk, co-founder of Wine Library, has been taking advantage of free
business tools for nearly three years to grow his 11-year-old wine retail
business. Using a combination of web-based tools, such as social networking,
blogging and video, he's taken his company to annual sales of $50 million. His
success with these tools has even landed him two book deals and regular
speaking engagements across the country. "Building brand equity and connecting
with your consumers through these social tools has a global impact on your
business and your brand," says Vaynerchuk, 33, who launched Wine Library with
his father, Sasha, 65.

Springfield, New Jersey-based Wine Library uses Facebook, MySpace and Twitter
to notify its "friends" about daily specials, something it used to do solely
through e-mail. Its Facebook presence includes a custom app called Ask Gary,
where people can ask questions about wine. And the company keeps a regular
video blog, Wine Library TV. "Viral aspects of your message explode once you
use these tools," says Vaynerchuk. "When I think about how much brand equity I
have with Wine Library TV and how quickly it happened for [so little cost],
the fact that I spent millions of dollars building the brand prior to using
these tools makes me want to throw up."

As Vaynerchuk has found, "customers appreciate the interaction," says Mike
Whaling, president of 30 Lines, a social media marketing company that helps
businesses expand their brands' online reach. "Traditionally, it was one way.
It was shouting: brochures, white papers, advertisements. Now it's much more
focused on multimedia and engagement." And whereas brochures and advertising
of days past had a price tag, more and more of today's tools are free.

But aside from the obvious (duh, it's free), what does this surge of tools
mean for small businesses? "It starts to level the playing field," says
Whaling. "It gives small businesses the opportunity to put themselves out
there and really compete with the larger companies."

"It allows a little guy to look like a big guy," says Drew McLellan, owner and
CEO of McLellan Marketing Group. "It makes a small business look very
sophisticated." For example, an entrepreneur can build a website easily with
various blogging and web design options. A company can launch a targeted
marketing campaign across numerous social networks. A business owner can
manage calendars, clients and projects using different collaborative and
project management software. All for free!

Alison Boris and Kathi Chandler, 38 and 31, respectively, have been
capitalizing on free tools since nearly the inception of their Los Angeles-
based online bag boutique, AllyKatStyle, in 2007. Like Vaynerchuk, they've
created a MySpace page for their company. They also have profiles on Digg and
StumbleUpon, which are community-centric content sharing sites, to drive
traffic to [allykatstyle.com](http://allykatstyle.com/). Outside of the
popular social networking tools, they use QuantCast (embedded in the website)
to monitor traffic, frequency, demographics, geographics and more, and Skype
is their official business phone. Says Chandler, "They're great grass-roots
tools to drive traffic to the site and provide free advertising through
bloggers and word-of-mouth."
