The IRS will never tell you why a particular tax return is under audit.
However, there are certain factors that make it obvious why a tax return was
selected.

**What Triggers an Audit?**  
Following is a comprehensive list of things that can trigger an IRS audit:

Failure to include income that has been reported to the Internal Revenue
Service  
During the month of January, you receive tax documents in the mail declaring
income and certain expenses that relate to your tax return. For example:

  * 1099-INT declaring the amount of interest income you've received from various sources including banks and investment companies
  * 1099-DIV declaring the amount of dividends you have been paid on your investments
  * 1099-MISC for work as an independent contractor and for rental income from tenants of your commercial properties
  * W-2s and K-1s

The Internal Revenue Service receives this same information. When you file
your tax return, the IRS plays a matching game to ensure that you have
declared all of this income on your tax return. If you have not, the IRS will
recalculate your tax liability and bill you accordingly. Also considered an
audit, it's basically a by-mail correction notice that is open to dispute.

**Severe departure from the national standards**  
The IRS has a construction of tables, available on its website at
[irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov/) , that indicate by income level and if self-
employed, by industry, an average of deductions taken in any given tax year.
If your numbers are significantly different than the national averages, you
may find your tax return up for scrutiny. Red flags include vehicle expense;
charitable contributions, especially noncash ones; meals, entertainment, and
travel; and excessively high cost of goods sold.

**Dramatic change in income and expenses from one year to the next**  
You may experience a financial downturn that throws you into a loss situation.
The IRS may audit just because it is interested in what happened and whether
or not you are hiding income. Or if your income suddenly increases, the IRS
may be suspicious that you cheated in the past and are now coming clean.

**Lifestyle**  
Lifestyle audits are supposedly a thing of the past. But come on, you know
that lifestyle comes into play. I mean, if you are living in a Beverly Hills
mansion, with mortgage interest of $200,000 per year, paying DMV fees on a
Ferrari, and making charitable contributions of $50,000 each year, then your
tax return had better show more than $36,000 of wages from Oil Changers,
right? These incongruities will flag your tax return for audit.

**Industry**  
Specific industry audits are a continuing IRS project. Every year the IRS
selects a particular industry to audit. In recent history it has selected wage
earners with a small Schedule C business (looking to blow hobby losses out of
the water), attorneys incorporated as S corporations (looking at unreasonable
compensation in order to add payroll tax liabilities), and trusts with
offshore holdings (looking for tax fraud and unreported income).
