Public Works

By 1997, the former car dealership that housed Sandy and Tom Hood's commercial
door and hardware distribution business was bulging at the seams. Besides
being cramped, it wasn't their ideal site. "We were growing and needed a
building that was conducive to business," recalls Sandy, who purchased the
company with husband Tom, 49, in 1989. "And our rent was going up. I thought
'For the amount we pay, it seems silly that we can't own.'"

And so began the search for commercial property on which to build a custom
facility for their less-than-$4-million firm, HC HoodCo Inc. in Bellefonte,
Pennsylvania. Sandy, 49, recalls that finding a suitable location was only
half the battle: "The next question was, Where were we going to get the
funding?"

From an unexpected source, as it turned out. While visiting the local chamber
in 1997, the Hoods learned that the state of Pennsylvania offered commercial
loans for job growth. They were surprised not only that financing was geared
to established businesses rather than startups, but also that the state's
interest rates rivaled what banks offered at the time.

After an extensive search for a new commercial site, the couple chose an
industrial park in Bellefonte. Upon learning of a successful local businessman
who was awarded a state loan, the Hoods investigated their options. They
qualified for a loan from Pennsylvania's Small Business First Fund, which
bankrolled half of the $400,000 project, requiring the couple to find a
private lender to finance the rest. There was one condition: For every $25,000
in state funds they received, the Hoods had to hire one employee. Fortunately,
they were planning to expand their employee roster anyway.

#### Under the Radar

While most states and scores of localities have loan programs to promote
business development, many entrepreneurs haven't heard of them. Even if
they're aware of public funding programs, they often have misconceptions about
the types of firms that qualify.

One common myth is that the credit initiatives are primarily for risky
ventures that aren't otherwise loan-worthy. "[These programs] are looking for
businesses with proven track records," says Peter Rassel, business consultant
at the [Georgia State University Small Business Development
Center](http://www.sba.gov/sbdc) in Atlanta. "They're willing to help them
expand their sales, which in turn will help expand the tax base as well as
increase employment. Often, the lower-interest loans and tax credits are used
in areas where there is high unemployment and the infrastructure has
deteriorated. They're trying to get companies to be entrepreneurial pioneers."

For business borrowers, public funding has a number of benefits. Not only are
the low-interest loans cheaper, but public funding programs also help make
some loan requests more palatable to private lenders, who frequently have to
put up matching funds. "Often, these loans can be considered equity
participation because they'll subordinate the debt to the private lender,
which will encourage the lender to lend more," Rassel explains. "It will be a
much larger transaction."

Business banker Myra Sletson agrees that public programs can boost borrowing
power: "These companies are often growing very quickly; and when they look at
taking on the additional debt they need to buy equipment, for working capital,
to build buildings, they're on the cusp of what the bank can do," says
Sletson, senior credit administrator for [Omega Financial
Corp.](http://www.omegafinancial.com) in State College, Pennsylvania. "The
public funds, at least in Pennsylvania, are structured to enable the bank to
make a loan that they might not be able to make without the public debt behind
them by enhancing the loan-to-value, reducing the risk to [the bank], and then
passing on some benefits [to the borrower] in the form of lower interest
rates, which help cash-flow issues."

Even so, many entrepreneurs don't pursue the strategy because of difficulty
locating funding sources, which can include states, municipalities and
nonprofit groups that dole out public funds. However, entrepreneurs can find
them with a well-placed phone call. State economic agencies commonly provide
referrals and assist businesses with loan applications. Local business groups
and trade associations are also usually aware of funding initiatives.

#### Read the Fine Print

Locating loans, however, is only part of the challenge; borrowers also have to
assess whether a particular program meets their needs. "Some won't finance
inventory, only equipment and fixed assets," Rassel stresses. "You have to
look at the language of what the program is about."

Or the business may have to remain in the state for a period of time,
potentially impeding growth plans. "A number of conditions should be reviewed
based on the strategic plan of the company to make sure the loan is good for
them," says Donna Holmes, director of the [Penn State Small Business
Development Center](http://www.research.psu.edu/sbdc).

Meanwhile, it's not uncommon for programs to restrict how borrowers can spend
loan proceeds. For instance, the federal government's Community Development
Block Grants, which are dispensed by local communities for economic growth,
require that contractors hired by the borrower pay the prevailing wage rate
for that location. Funding recipients, in turn, must submit supporting
documentation. "If you can't do it," Rassel says, "that part of the loan
package will fall out. The paperwork can be tremendous."

#### Time Is Money

Bear in mind, the process leading up to financing is generally 30 to 60 days
longer and potentially more complicated with public funding than with regular
credit. After filing in March, the Hoods waited for financing until August.

One reason for delays, says Holmes, is that public programs often customize
loan documents, while banks have a more standardized process. "And a lot of
times, there are review committees, which typically meet at a certain time in
the month. You have to look at that cycle and determine what time in the month
they're going to look at [your request]," she advises. "If you miss that time,
you have to wait possibly another month before that committee will get
together again, as compared to a bank, where somebody is there every day."

Public funding requires patience and careful planning, but the savings can
make it well worth the effort. "These are programs that we generally use for
decent credits because they get a rate advantage and save money on down
payments," says Ronald Haring, senior vice president and regional development
officer of Omega Bank. "Whereas banks would want 25 percent down, you can do
these programs and take 10 percent."

Persistence Pays

After receiving a state-financed commercial loan in 1997, Bellefonte,
Pennsylvania, entrepreneurs Tom and Sandy Hood expanded their search to other
types of publicly funded business assistance. They discovered that their state
was teeming with resources, if only business owners looked in the right
places.

"Being a small company with limited cash, I'm always looking for ways to
upgrade employees' training and make our company better," says Sandy, whose
commercial door and hardware distribution company, HC HoodCo Inc., received
its first state grant, a $20,000 award for job training, in 1999. The Hoods
were later awarded a $6,000 grant for computer training and another $5,000 to
teach employees additional job skills.

Sandy attributes the couple's success in obtaining state grants to working
closely with the local chamber and Small Business Development Center. She
advises making contacts at local business groups, which, in addition to
providing program information, can help a company determine eligibility.
