Managing Your Cash Flow

Q: Can you give me some tips on managing the cash flow of my new business?

A: If there's one thing that will make or break your company, especially when
it's small, it's cash flow. A banker once told me that of the many companies
he saw go out of business, the majority of them were profitable-they just got
in a cash crunch, and that forced them to close. If you pay close attention to
your cash flow and think about it every single day, you'll have an edge over
almost all your competitors, and you will keep growing while other companies
fall by the wayside. The amount of attention you pay to cash flow can
literally mean the difference between life and death for your company.

Let's take a look at some basics. What does "cash flow" mean, anyway? For the
moment, don't think about profits and losses, your balance sheet, gross
margins, etc. Perhaps the simplest way to think about cash flow is to just
think of the balance in your checking account. Will that balance be enough to
pay your bills when they come due? That's the point of this whole concept-the
further out you can predict your bank balance, the further out you can see a
problem, and the longer you have to deal with it.

As you start to think about it, you'll realize that you can pretty easily
forecast most of your expenses, at least for the next few months. Once you
have that in mind, add the revenue that you believe you'll receive, and do the
math. Cash-flow management is simple in concept but can be complex in
execution. Why? Partly because it's tough to decide how to get started, and
partly because it takes serious discipline to consistently look at this when
there are often more interesting things vying for your time.

Over the years, I've tried many different tools, and I finally settled on one
that has saved my neck over and over: the "cash-flow spreadsheet," which
accompanies this article. This sample version is intentionally simplistic; my
experience is that this is a very personal tool and that if you adopt it, you
will want to customize it to your own tastes. I have seen some very complex
and powerful cash-flow spreadsheets that track every penny that comes in and
out of a company.

There are a couple of ways to look at cash flow: prevention (manage the
business such that you see problems coming and can deal with them early on)
and cure (deal with problems when they get here). Prevention is by far the
best option. If you plan ahead and look for problems as far out as possible,
you can avoid many of them and lessen the severity of the ones you can't
avoid.

In the end, if you've worked hard on prevention but still find yourself with
an unexpected problem, what can you do about it? If you haven't been planning
on this happening, you may face some painful choices: Borrow from your
personal funds, delay paying some vendors, delay payroll, try to convince a
customer to pay their bill early, etc. A much better plan is to have a close
relationship with your banker. Don't make the mistake of treating your banker
as an outsider; treat him or her as a partner, and send them frequent
financial reports. The more a banker knows about your business, the more
confidence he will have in you, and the more willing he will be to help out if
you get in a cash crunch. Another important tool is a line of credit from your
bank. Think of this as business overdraft protection for your checking
account. If you've got that in place (and the time to look into this is not
the day you need the money!) and a customer is slow to pay, you can draw on it
until your invoices come in.

The bottom line with cash-flow management is to develop the tools and
discipline to manage it constantly, look for problems as far into the future
as possible, and set up a good plan for dealing with the problems you can't
avoid.
