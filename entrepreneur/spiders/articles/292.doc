Woe Is the CFO

If you thought small-business CFOs weren't reeling from the Enron implosion
like the financial chiefs of their billion-dollar brethren, you thought wrong.
"I definitely feel the heat," says Arthur Tanner, CFO of Circle Group Internet
Inc., a 34-employee Mundelein, Illinois, company that provides capital-raising
and consulting services to emerging-growth companies.

Tanner, who recently prepared his company for listing on the OTC Bulletin
Board, says the scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and auditors has been
intense. Where they once gave certain numbers a cursory glance, "now they're
asking more and more questions," says Tanner. "Everybody was a little bit more
apprehensive than in the past, double-checking, triple-checking the numbers."
As auditors scramble to rebuild their reputations, they're putting more
pressure on their clients. "I have to know the rules a lot better because
there are going to be more rules," says Tanner.

Indeed. The post-Enron slew of proposals for regulatory reform and accounting
changes was only the beginning, despite the the fact that, at press time, many
of the proposed measures were not expected to pass. "I don't think we've seen
the tip of the iceberg as far as changes to accounting treatments that will
ripple through small companies," says Richard Brenner, CEO of The Brenner
Group Inc., a Cupertino, California-based company that provides interim
executive management.

That will likely heap further complexity onto the role of the CFO, which has
been continuously evolving over the past three decades. Once considered to be
simply bean-counters, CFOs were forced by the M&A craze of the 1980s to become
deal strategists; the '90s and the dotcom boom added investor-relations savvy
to the roster of required skills and thrust finance chiefs into the celebrity
spotlight.

Enter the dotcom bust and the Enron fiasco, which have swung the pendulum back
toward a greater emphasis on traditional control and planning. CFOs still have
to wear many hats and demonstrate superior financial acumen, but in an
increasingly hostile, zero-tolerance environment, they also must convince
shareholders and boards that they're pure as snow.

"There's a lot of caution in the hiring process [for CFOs]," notes Michael
Flannery, co-chief executive of Redwood Partners, an integrated advisory firm
in New York City that provides executive search and venture capital services
to growing companies. "We are getting requests to do many more background
checks, criminal checks, all sorts of different things to make sure no one has
to look over their shoulder down the line."

The caution is understandable. While smaller companies don't have the same
opportunity to do the extensive kind of off-balance-sheet activity that led to
Enron's demise, they can still get into big trouble when the CFO operates
below-board. "If the CEO does not have a strong advocate and advisor to be his
conscience, he can run amok in a small company," says Brenner. One or two
wrong turns can erase shareholder value quickly. "And my shareholders care
just as much about their investment as Enron's shareholders do," says Tanner.

Which is why many entrepreneurs are taking fewer chances on CFOs who lack a
full range of expert skills. Philip Livingston, president and CEO of Financial
Executives International in Morristown, New Jersey, points out that Enron CFO
Andy Fastow's narrow specialty in finance was a weakness. "When a person [has
advanced to the level of] CFO, they should have experience in multiple areas
of finance-that's accounting, budgeting, planning, tax, treasury and investor
relations," says Livingston.

That's a tall order, particularly for small-business CFOs. "The CFOs of small
companies today are really super-comptrollers," says Brenner. Most of them, he
adds, rose through the accounting ranks to their current position. Brenner
contends a true CFO is a genuine business partner, not a historical reporter
or accountant. "The CFO should be intimately involved with and understand all
the business decisions a company [will] make to grow," says Brenner. "His job
is not just to talk about the financial implications, but to participate in
what the impact of those strategic decisions will be."

How can you tell whether your CFO measures up? Larry Downes, consultant and
author of _The Strategy Machine: Building Your Business One Idea At a Time_
(HarperBusiness), advises giving a quick quiz. "Ask your CFO to tell you the
last five legal or regulatory changes they looked at to see if they had an
impact on how the company was doing its books," says Downes. "If they can't
name five in the last two years, that's a problem." To test the CFO's
knowledge of the company's strategic mission-which he or she will need to use
finance as a competitive weapon-ask him or her to name the company's five most
valuable intellectual or information assets. "If they say 'What's an
information asset?' you know you have a problem," says Downes. "That's not the
CFO you want."
