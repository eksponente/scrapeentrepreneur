4 Reasons Your Business Plan Might Need to Be Trashed

You’ve done it. You’ve created a business plan. Maybe you’ve even made it
official by having it laminated and bound. After all, nothing makes a plan
feel more real than Venn diagrams, charts and timelines as you set off to
explore the daunting and unfamiliar territory of turning your idea into a
scalable, repeatable business model.

While preparation is always good, no amount of charts can protect you from the
realities of a 21st-century business world in permanent beta. In this brave
new globally networked economy, the name of the game is "flexibility." So when
you set out to startup your business plan, it’s essential that you keep some
key factors in mind:

## 1\. Consumer needs are constantly evolving.

As the Dude puts it in _The Big Lebowski_, "New s**t has come to light" and
your business model should evolve based on the “new s**t." Startups that
embrace this will stand a better chance at survival.

Pinterest, which was founded by a designer, is always evolving and improving
in response to user needs, including adding better search capabilities to
tailor your experience. Tweaks like this may seem minor, but they’re the
difference between thriving and floundering in a competitive market.

## 2\. Being psychic is a tough job.

Anyone who claims to be able to accurately predict the future will fail if
they base that prediction on data that is no longer relevant or current. While
the future has always been uncertain, the rate of change is greatly
accelerated even from 10 years ago.

The rise of the [lean process](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) and
[agile software methodology](http://agilemethodology.org/) as major influences
on business models helps us adjust to change rather than to predict.

## 3\. Business ideas are never fully baked.

When developing a new business, it’s important to have a clear vision of where
you want it to go. That being said, not even Steve Jobs could predict what
Apple would one day become, and frankly, that’s what helped it grow into what
it is today.

Business plans often detract from grandiose visions because they are
inherently formulaic. Let your vision lead.

## 4\. Experimentation lives outside of a pie chart.

While the goal of a startup is to mature into a model that is scalable and
repeatable, this needs to be balanced with experimentation and innovation that
can’t be measured in a pie chart or line graph.

[The Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc)
looks beyond those charts and is especially useful because it combines a
practical and tangible approach in covering the various areas and aspects of
planning a business but emphasizes the need to iterate as conditions change.

## Conclusion

Business models per se will not be going away -- but how we see them and how
we use them has already radically changed. Now more than ever, businesses must
focus on the demand side as well as supply side. It is crucial to place an
early emphasis on identifying the customer and developing product research and
development with early adopters who function as beta testers.

Competition and opportunity are now globally focused but at the same time
personalized. Terrain and market share can change rapidly. So the lifespan of
a particular business model can be very brief, as it will need to remain open
to changing conditions and developments and iterate to remain relevant and
profitable.
