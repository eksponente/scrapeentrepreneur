Follow The Rules

"Bulls and bears aren't responsible for as many stock losses as bum steers."
_\--Olin Miller_

Recently, a new client came in to meet with me. About to retire, he wanted to
be sure he could maintain his lifestyle with his current investments. As he
pulled out his retirement plan statement, his whole demeanor changed. "I can't
believe I've left all this money in a money-market fund for the past six
years," he said. "I could have done so much better if only I had invested a
little of it in the stock market. I was just so afraid of losing it that I
didn't do anything."

Certainly, this investor was justified in his fear of market fluctuations.
There's always some measure of risk when investing in stocks--and a chance
you'll lose money. Unfortunately, however, thanks to the bite taken by
inflation and taxes, you can also lose purchasing power in money-market funds
and similar investments. Our investor didn't realize his money-market fund was
neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government. And there's no
assurance such a fund will maintain a stable net asset value of one dollar.

The moral of the story? To retire in the style to which he's accustomed, our
investor may be forced to work longer or to invest more aggressively than he
might have had he included a partial investment in stocks in his portfolio
from the start.

Wouldn't it be nice to learn from someone else's mistakes for a change, or at
least to avoid making the same mistakes twice? With that in mind, here are
eight of the most common errors made by astute (and some not-so-astute)
investors. Tally up how many of them you've made, and review the sections
you're weak in. If you tick off fewer than two, consider yourself an expert;
three to five, you need some help; six to eight, it's time to brush up on the
basics of personal finance! Read on to see how you fare.
