Quiz: Risk Assessment Calculator

The current economic situation creates a dilemma of sorts for entrepreneurs.
Due to the economic slowdown and a lack of sales, businesses have seen their
balance sheets deteriorate to the point that they are no longer a viable
credit risk. Thus, banks have restricted their credit and lending policies,
severely impacting entrepreneurial firms. What's the solution? Entrepreneurs
need to focus on the big three: cash, sales and debt. Below is a simple quiz;
the higher your score, the better you are financially.

**Cash  
** 1) **Cash flow: How long can you pay your current monthly bills using the cash you have on hand?  
** 31-60 days +3 7-30 days +1 Less than 7 days -3

2) **Monthly cash flow divided by interest expense:  
** Greater than 2.0 +3 1.01 to 1.99 +1 Less than 1.0 -3

**Sales  
** 3) **Revenue growth over the past year:**   
Increased +3 Held on to customers +1 Decreased -3

4) **Percent increase in new customers (from last quarter)  
** Greater than 10 percent +3 From 1 to 10 percent -1 Lost up to 10 percent of customer base -3

**Debt**   
5) **Debt to assets ratio:**  
No debt +3 .01 to .79 +1 Greater than .80 -3

6) **Business credit card debt:  
** No debt +3 $1,000 to $2,499 +1 Greater than $2,500 -3  
Remember, the solution to surviving tough times is balancing the three-legged
stool--cash, sales and debt. Pay attention to all three and you should do OK.
