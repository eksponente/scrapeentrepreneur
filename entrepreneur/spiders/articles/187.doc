Can I Take Your Orders?

For modular office furniture manufacturer Design Resource Group International
Inc., timing was everything. Though its niche was small office installations,
the Pine Brook, New Jersey, producer wanted to bid on larger projects when the
right opportunity presented itself.

Larger competitors, however, had an advantage. Deep pockets allowed them to
offer customers flexible financing terms, while Design Resource Group used
deposits to fund orders for the three- to four-month period it took to get
paid. Meanwhile, some potential clients, particularly government agencies,
rarely made down payments.

Even with bank credit, constricted cash flow hampered growth. "Banks tend to
say, 'Make money slowly and build your own cash flow so that, at some point,
you can do these jobs off of your own profits and your own cash,'" says David
LaTorre, CFO of the $50 million company. "The window of opportunity is
generally short, and if we're not there to at least bid on these projects,
they may not be there next year or the following year."

LaTorre's previous employer, a gourmet food manufacturer, had a similar
funding shortfall during an expansion opportunity in the late 1990s. Its
accountant recommended purchase order financing, a form of asset-based lending
through which businesses can obtain credit to pay suppliers, laborers and
other intermediaries for goods or services they need to generate additional
sales. For rapidly growing companies, the need for capital is often acute.
Huge orders, seasonal sales spikes and market expansions can place strain on a
business's cash flow, thus jeopardizing future sales opportunities.

After joining Design Resource Group last year, LaTorre learned that the
company would need extra credit to capitalize on significant business
opportunities, such as refurbishing the corporate offices of a multinational
firm. He called Westgate Financial Corp., the Hoboken, New Jersey-based lender
that financed the earlier growth spurt at his former company.

"It's out-of-the-box financing that banks typically don't like to do on the
front side of large projects," LaTorre, 37, explains. "We have grown
explosively over the past several years, and much of that is because we're
able to obtain financing like this. That can add 20 to 30 percent in growth
opportunities right away."

**Closing the Credit Gap**

Whereas a factor advances funds on a company's receivables, purchase order
financing is used to buy inventory. In exchange for advancing funds for
inventory-typically finished or nearly finished goods-the lender receives a
percentage of the cost of the goods, usually in the range of 1 to 3 percent
for a 30- to 45-day transaction. However, the cost varies depending on how the
deal is underwritten and the client's historical performance.

While lenders have industry preferences, actual transactions are similarly
structured. The funds are applied to the manufacture of goods to fulfill a
purchase order, including raw materials and labor, or used to purchase
finished goods, either from a domestic or overseas manufacturer. "It fits the
gap between traditional bank financing or debt financing and equity," says
Paul Schuldiner, national business development director for Northbrook,
Illinois-based Transcap Trade Finance, a joint venture with Transamerica
Commercial Finance Corp.

Purchase order financing is geared to wholesalers, distributors or importers
that outsource production of consumer goods, including apparel, sporting
goods, furniture, computer hardware and housewares. "There's a time frame
needed to build up the inventory and production requirements," says
Schuldiner, "and if they're importing from overseas, frequently the lead times
could be 30, 60 or 90 days. They would typically tie up their collateral with
their other lenders for that period of time."

Schuldiner maintains that purchase order financing can coexist with bank or
venture capital funding. "It creates better cash flow for the client, which
flows through to the existing lender," he adds. "Clients may have an equity
sponsor or venture capital group that has sponsored the first round or two,
but they don't necessarily want to put in additional equity. They're able to
leverage off our funding because we provide transaction capital and don't
typically take an equity position in a company. As such, we don't dilute the
ownership interests of the existing shareholders."

In fact, banks are a leading referral source, along with factors and other
asset-based lenders, followed by accountants and consultants, then brokers and
attorneys. In terms of lending criteria, industry experience and whether the
company has sufficient cash flow to cover expenses are key considerations.
Additionally, lenders prefer relationships with borrowing companies-the
typical credit line is set up for a 12- to 18-month period-to one-off deals.

**Bring on the Bank**

Niche players who lend against purchase orders are typically providing credit
to companies with established bank ties. Even with a bank's support, it's a
complicated arrangement in which concerns arise over ownership of collateral.
Additionally, banks are reluctant to have multiple institutions filing liens
and rights to a company's assets. "Typically, inventory receivables are the
most tangible assets a bank wants to have as collateral, and when you're
financing purchase orders, the first thing it does is create inventory,"
LaTorre says. "When that inventory, in our case, is in the water from Korea,
it's technically Westgate's inventory. Then it gets sent to the end-user and
becomes a receivable. It becomes an issue of who owns and has rights to the
two pieces-when it's inventory and then when it becomes receivables."

Businesses can allay concerns by proactively managing the relationship between
bank and purchase order lender, says banker Lyle Frederickson. "It's important
that the business owner act as mediator to establish and enhance the
relationship," he says. "Take them both to lunch and make sure everyone
understands the terms. You want everyone to be invested and committed."

Frederickson, senior vice president of Arizona Business Bank in Phoenix, says
the financing tool is mutually beneficial for the bank and borrower. The bank
can further gauge the company's creditworthiness, while the entrepreneur
eventually gains access to less expensive credit. "Once the company is through
this growth period requiring purchase order financing, they can get into
receivables financing," he says. "Once that happens, it will be easier for
them to get that financing because we've watched the behavior, we've seen that
there haven't been overdrafts, we've seen the lockbox funds coming in, and we
know who their customers are. We'll probably be able to move into asset-based
lending more quickly than if we hadn't been affiliated with the credit."
