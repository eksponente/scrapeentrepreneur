What Is Your Business Worth?

**Q:** How do I place a value on my company?

**A:** In reality, valuing a business is much more of an art than a science. The most widely accepted value will be defined by how reasonable the figure is relative to the assumptions used in the analysis. I just finished an early round of growth capital bargaining for an emerging enterprise. The deal was put on hold while both sides regrouped (and rethought) each other's valuation positions.

Most financial professionals will admit there's as much qualitative input as
there is quantitative number-crunching when it comes to performing valuations.
Even when two valuators do agree on the methodology, they may vary on the
assumptions used in that model and then arrive at very different values for
the firm. So it requires a blend of _pro forma_ cash flows, tangible assets,
financial and industry ratios, earnings multiples and a wide range of "comps,"
all shaded by investor sentiment, personal gut feeling and a healthy dose of
reasonableness.

Let's look at two perspectives in the context of one of my recent deals. A
newly launched engineering design, manufacturing and distribution company had
fewer than 30 employees and had never done more than $825,000 in sales in any
of its first three years. However, the business began to book a steady stream
of new contracts for OEM custom component parts, and applications systems and
devices to keep company operations running strong over the next few years.

Based on the recent flurry of new potential sales, the growth curve was
plotted for the next four years, and it was somewhere in the range of 20
percent per quarter. In order to support this ramped-up scale, the facilities,
IT capabilities, personnel and communications systems needed significant
upgrades of around $2.2 million. A partnership of two angel investors and a
smaller venture capital firm were approached, and within two weeks, they
showed interest in funding the deal through an equity stake.

The potential investors hired a private firm to do a valuation, and I
performed a competing valuation for my client. Later, we met at the
negotiating table to talk about the industry prospects, the entrepreneurs and
key management team's background, the company's innovative patented new
designs, and the overall sales prospects. When we sat down, we were separated
by a factor of more than 30 percent. (My value was 30 percent higher than
their value.) To further complicate things, my client already thought that my
value was less than half of what it should be.

Valuation can be derived from any combination of the following eight models:

Net assets after all debts are excluded  
Net liquidation at fair market pricing  
Replacement costs at existing market levels  
Adjusted goodwill on excess earnings  
Recent comparable sale price  
Comparable public company price  
Comparable price-earnings multiple  
Present value of after-tax cash flow

I prefer to start with the discounted present value of the after-tax cash flow
and compare that to recent sales of similar firms. Then I look at the market
capitalization of similar publicly traded firms and similar industry PE
multiples. The combination of these three should be _reasonable_ and make
sense for both parties. But one of my close business associates has often
said, "The correct valuation is the one the capital provider will agree to."

Be sure the valuation passes the critical test of reasonableness. Does the
value accurately reflect the company, industry-risks and expected returns for
the future? Whatever you come up with determines how much equity you'll
relinquish to the funding group and how much stock you'll have left for
subsequent rounds of growth capital in the future. Strong sales and profit
results in the next few months will strengthen my position on the value of the
company described in the example above during future deal talks. Poor
performance in the coming months will make my value appear far too optimistic.
Concessions on valuation might be necessary to keep forward momentum in your
operations, but in the end, make sure the final value truly makes sense.
