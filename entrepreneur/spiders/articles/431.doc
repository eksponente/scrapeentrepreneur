New Rules for Charitable Donations

Starting this year, the rules for deducting donations are a bit more
stringent. First, charitable contributions now require documentation.
Acceptable forms include cancelled checks, bank or credit card statements
showing the funds transfer/payment, or written acknowledgement from the
charity with the amount and date of the contribution. So, before you drop cash
into the Salvation Army Santa's bucket or into the collection plate at your
house of worship, think about using a check if you want to take the deduction.

Also, as of August 17, 2006, deducting donated clothing and household goods is
no longer allowed unless they are in "used or better" condition. While the IRS
hasn't defined what that means, it definitely frowns on donating items of
minimal value, like used undergarments. This doesn't apply to contributions of
items valued at $500 or more if a qualified appraisal is done.

If you give clothes or household goods to charity and would like a guide to
help value these items, you can download the "Non-Cash Contributions
Worksheet" from my website,
[www.neimanonline.com](http://www.neimanonline.com/), in the "Forms and
Resources" tab.

For donated items valued at more than $500, the recipient needs to provide you
with documentation specifying whether the property will be sold or used by the
organization. If the donated property is sold, your deduction is limited to
the sale price. This is important if you plan to donate a car or any other
piece of property. You are responsible for contacting the organization to find
out whether the property has been sold.

Also, donating property with a fair market value of more than $5,000 is
subject to new recapture rules. If the charity sells the property within three
years, the difference between your purchase price and the amount claimed as a
deduction must be recaptured (i.e., classified as income). You can avoid the
income recapture if the charity certifies to the IRS that the property use was
related to the charitable purpose of the organization.

Lastly, taxpayers older than 70 and a half now can make donations of up to
$100,000 directly from their IRAs without paying income tax on the
distribution. The contribution must be made using a direct transfer from the
IRA trustee to the qualified charity. Required minimum distributions--RMDs or
MRDs--qualify for this treatment. The taxpayer can't receive anything in
exchange for this contribution or take it as a deduction on their tax return.

As always, refer to your tax advisor or financial planner for information on
your specific situation.
