Community Banks to the Rescue

With credit markets in turmoil and megabanks in trouble, the community [best
banks](http://www.entrepreneur.com/bestbanks) are thinking one thing: "Where
there's chaos, there's opportunity." So says Anita Gentle Newcomb, president
of A.G. Newcomb & Co., who sees the credit crisis as a chance for community
banks to rise above their convenient, tech-savvy competitors via developments
like remote deposit capture, a service that allows customers to deposit checks
electronically.  
  
One company helping these small banks close the gap is Texas-based BancVue,
which is revitalizing the community banking industry with innovative products
like RealTunes, an account that lets customers earn music downloads instead of
interest, and RealGiving, which donates earned interest to a charity of
choice. The company, which plans to roll out new products monthly, is expected
to gather more than $35 million this year, and has been gaining momentum over
the last four.  
  
Just 15 years ago, community banks owned 70 percent of the market share in
terms of deposits. Now it's down to 34 percent, says BancVue co-founder Don
Shafer, whose long-term goal is to put big banks out of business. "Community
banks are pretty far behind," he says. "Some are still hazy about online
banking and need to come up with a strategy." That's where BancVue and its
approximately 600 clients come in. "With that kind of presence, we can be
loud," Shafer says.  
  
While BancVue is geeking out community banks, marketing agencies like Creative
Brand Communications are giving them an edge. Incommons Bank, one of Creative
Brand's clients, is a testament to the power of reinvention. With Creative
Brand's help, the formerly staid First National Bank of Mexia changed its name
and renewed its focus on building real connections through small but genuine
actions--like shaking hands with every customer who comes into the bank. The
verdict? "We lasted. It worked," says bank CFO Brad Butler.  
  
Many more banks are following suit, says Newcomb. "My firm is extremely busy
this year working with community banks that are looking for ways to
differentiate themselves in the marketplace, particularly from an innovation
perspective."
