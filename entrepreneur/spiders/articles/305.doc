Stock Options

When Jeff Behrens thought about expanding his Newton, Massachusetts-based
computer systems management firm, he knew he'd need a cash infusion. "We're
doing about one and a half million in annual sales, but cash was always
tight," says Behrens, president of The Tulluride Group Inc., who discovered
that private sale of stock could be a low-cost source for growth capital and
expertise.

**Public vs. Private**

Entrepreneurs are often lured by the appeal of selling stock on the open
market: Instant cash realization with no debt to repay. But most are not in a
position to go public with the complexities of a public offering-especially in
an uncertain market, when a successful IPO is far from guaranteed.

A more practical option is selling private equity stock to a few people who
have confidence in your product. There are no investment bankers or financial
consultants to worry about, and you can maintain the control associated with a
privately held company, all while reaping the advantages of instant cash and
no debt. An added bonus is the potential to bring others' expertise to your
venture. "In addition to raising expansion capital, selling stock to private
individuals allowed me to tie the investors tightly to the company and benefit
from their advice and counsel on growing the business," says Behrens, 34.

Why would an investor choose your private stock over a hot IPO? Their direct
access to you and your company puts them in a much better position to
effectively evaluate the risks and rewards of their investment.

**To Sell or Not to Sell**

You should ask yourself two questions to determine whether a private equity
sale is right for your company. First, is there any market for your stock?
Understand that investors will want to know specifically how you intend to use
the money and what type of return to expect, as well as a timeline.

"Selling stock is a great way for a growing company to raise money it needs to
succeed," explains J. David Washburn, a Dallas attorney who advises
entrepreneurs on practical and legal issues surrounding selling private stock.
"But your company must be in a growth position in order to attract private
investors."

Washburn says plans to inflate your own salary or pay off old debts with
investors' money will not snag any investors. Rather, you must first bring the
company to a level where the investor will have confidence in the potential
rewards from the investment.

Second, are you willing to give up a little control in exchange for equity?
Selling private stock also carries responsibilities for your new shareholders.
They will have the right to elect directors of the corporation, inspect books
and records, and, depending on the set agreements, vote on major corporate
decisions, such as selling assets.

"Raising money sets certain expectations about future company growth and
plans," says Behrens. "[Once outside investors are involved,] it is no longer
a personal lifestyle business-the owner now has fiduciary responsibilities to
the investors."
