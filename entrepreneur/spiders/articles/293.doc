Granting Your Wishes

**Q:** Where can I find reliable grant sources for starting my own homebased IT consulting business, and what are my chances of receiving funding from them?  
_Name withheld_

**A:** Grants for starting a business are few and far between. A search through The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( [www.cfda.gov](http://www.cfda.gov) ) will lead you to two types of grants: one for rural businesses and one for minority business enterprises. However, even for these, there are qualifiers.

Eligible applicants for the rural money are public entities and nonprofit
corporations that may in turn award money to the residents they serve. They
have a strong emphasis on helping existing businesses grow. Similarly, the
grants for minority enterprises are awarded only to established businesses and
community organizations.

Some individuals may find grant money for starting a business from vocational
rehabilitation funds administered by state agencies serving the disabled. One
way to find out if your state will do this is to contact your state
representative or senator.

From time to time, private grant money is given to very small businesses. For
example, The Amber Foundation ( [www.womensnet.net](http://www.womensnet.net)
) favors businesses already underway, although this foundation has not awarded
grants in two years.

As you can see, grants are neither readily available nor easy to get. Thus,
most people start a business by bootstrapping, tightening their living
expenses, turning to savings, lining up business in advance or cajoling loans
from family and friends. If you qualify, you can apply for a federal microloan
administered through private organizations in various communities. Visit [www.
