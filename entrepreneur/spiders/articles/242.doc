Getting Money to Grow

You may have used personal savings or money borrowed from friends and family
to get started, but where do you go when it's time to grow your business? If
you've been in business for less than three years or have nothing to offer as
collateral, you might find traditional lending institutions unwilling to
finance your business. There are options, though--if you know where to look.

Going back to those same friends and family--but making it a formal loan with
a set repayment plan and interest--might be a viable option, if you haven't
already gone this route. For instance, an institution like
[CircleLending](http://www.circlelending.com/) \--which administers loans
between individuals by handling and storing all the documentation, creating a
repayment schedule, taking care of payments through debits and direct
deposits, and even handling collections if the loans go into default--can make
things easier for both you and your loved ones.

"There's this huge volume of loans between individuals in this country, and
there really is no third party to reduce the high rates of default which
typically occur in these loans," says Asheesh Advani, president and CEO of
CircleLending, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. According to Advani, $65
billion a year is transacted between family and friends in the form of loans.
In addition, 14 percent of the total amount of money raised by businesses
comes from friends and family.

While borrowing from friends and family may be an alternative, however, what
if your need exceeds what you can borrow from them? When Paul Entin founded
his previous business, Fitnesslink.com, the company grew rapidly, and he knew
he needed to seek outside funding to bolster the technology he was using to
run the site. Unwilling to give up control of his company to a venture
capitalist--he'd been approached several times--he instead got a microloan
from an SBA-backed lender. The infusion of funds allowed Entin to beef up the
technology in his business, which he subsequently sold.

So when it came time to find funding for his current business--
[epr](http://www.eprmarketing.com/) , a Washington, New Jersey, marketing and
advertising firm specializing in industrial clients--he knew exactly where to
look. "We had talked to our bank and investigated other ways, like home equity
loans, but this seemed like the most effective way to go. It was a fair
interest rate, plus they were able to give us the loan without having a
[drawn-out] process upfront," says Entin, who invested the $27,000 from his
second loan into office equipment and materials.

And although Entin doesn't plan on adding employees--he outsources a lot of
graphic design to a network of freelance professionals--or moving out of his
home office anytime soon, any future expansions in the business will likely be
funded by microloans.

If you lack funds on a short-term basis, think about creative forms of
financing, such as pre-selling. "We teach [our students] to use a customer as
the basis of funding," notes Professor Ken Proudfoot, director of the Larry
Friedman International Center for Entrepreneurship at [Johnson & Wales
University](http://www.jwu.edu/) in Providence, Rhode Island. "And the way
that works is by pre-selling the product or service--taking a deposit for the
delivery of the product or service in advance of actually delivering it," says
Proudfoot. You can then use the deposit to purchase the materials you may need
to deliver the product at a later date.

Another method of obtaining financing for supplies or materials is to approach
vendors of those products about opening a line of credit with them. With
flexible terms of payment, you can stock your inventory or buy raw materials
for your product without having to put the cash upfront.

Now before you go out and borrow from anyone, make sure you have a bona fide
need. Money won't solve problems in your business, warns Proudfoot, and you
shouldn't expand your capacity without first ensuring you have the customer
base to justify the expansion.
