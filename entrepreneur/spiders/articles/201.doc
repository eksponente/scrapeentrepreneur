Do It Your Way

Mutual funds continue to struggle with image problems in the wake of a bear
market and subsequent trading scandals. In the meantime, one investment
alternative in particular has been coming on strong: separately managed
accounts, or SMAs.

Catering to people with at least six-, but more likely seven-figure amounts to
invest, assets in SMAs have bucked the bearish environment to grow at a 7
percent annual clip since 1999. Fund assets have slipped 3 percent per year
over that time.

Sold by banks and brokerages (and, increasingly, fund companies), SMAs are
one-stop shops that offer a gaggle of money managers under one roof, each
specializing in a single asset category. The SMA takes your investment
preferences, and the managers, in turn, create a portfolio of stocks, bonds
and other securities based on your parameters. Each manager has a model
portfolio, but he or she can adjust things based on your needs and wants. It's
essentially a custom mutual fund.

Customization, though, does come at a cost. Expect to pay 1.5 to 3 percent in
expenses for equity managers and maybe a little less for fixed-income money
managers. Most mutual funds can be had for significantly less.

You do get several things in exchange for the higher fees, however-foremost
among them, tax advantages. Mutual funds buy and sell securities all the time
inside their portfolios, and investors have to pick up the tab for the capital
gains generated. SMAs, on the other hand, give you flexibility to direct the
buying and selling so you can manage the tax burden-offsetting gains against
losses, for example. The accounts also make it easier to see what you own at
any given time, allowing you to minimize "style drift," or overlap between
portfolios.

Even so, you need plenty of tax savings to overcome the costs. Although you
can invest in some SMAs with as little as $100,000, many advisors say the
savings won't overcome the fees unless you have at least $1 million to put in
the pot. If that doesn't give you pause, SMAs might be worth a look.

Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Prudential, Smith Barney, UBS and Wachovia
manage the bulk of SMAs in the country, although other companies will surely
emerge as the business grows. Morningstar, which for years has given star
rankings to mutual funds, started doing the same for SMA providers late last
year. It's probably a good idea to check the ratings out before you take the
plunge.
