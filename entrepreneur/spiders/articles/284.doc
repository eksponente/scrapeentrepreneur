License to Profit

[Ambient Devices](http://www.ambientdevices.com) is not your typical high-tech
company. The company's first product, the eerily glowing Ambient Orb, broke
new ground in the consumer electronics space and landed squarely on the cover
of the _Hammacher Schlemmer_ catalog in May 2002. Building on technology first
conceived at the MIT Media Lab, the company is not only turning out eye-
popping products, but also turning heads with a business model that
substitutes royalties for venture capital and helps launch new competitors.

Like many growing companies, Ambient has some key intellectual property-
patents, trademarks and other "secret formulas." Most companies, however,
would use such technology simply to tempt investors and then squirrel it away
from the rest of the world. Ambient turns that model on its head by eschewing
investors while spreading its technology far and wide through aggressive
licensing. It's a strategy that squeezes huge economic value out of the
Ambient patent portfolio and gives the company an important (and largely
passive) source of funds.

In general, Ambient wants to license its wireless technology, called "bit-
trickling," to consumer electronics giants like Sony and also encourage new
start-ups to use the patents for smaller niche plays. All that, while Ambient
builds and markets its own products, like the $149 Orb and the $179 Weather
Forecast Beacon.

"This strategy came out of lessons I've learned from previous start-ups," says
Ambient co-founder and vice president of strategy Nabeel Hyatt, 27. "This is a
new way to say 'Let some other entrepreneurs take advantage of the
opportunities.'"

Selling not just products, but also licenses for core technology pays off
handsomely for Hyatt and his team. Although he says they spend only about 5
percent of their time helping other companies launch products, nearly 15
percent of Ambient's revenues come from that activity. "And that could grow to
50 percent next year," says Hyatt. "There are a hundred good opportunities
outside the consumer market for Ambient technology-entire industries that are
not being touched."

To mine the value in intellectual property, you first have to know what you've
got, says intellectual property attorney Rose Auslander, a partner in the
Intellectual Property Group at the New York City law firm [Carter Ledyard &
Milburn LLP](http://www.clm.com). "A lot of people have intellectual property
of great value and don't even realize it." Whether you design jewelry or jet
engines, create skyscrapers or software, the fruits of your labor can be
captured as intellectual property and put to work again and again through
licensing.

Identify it, secure it and protect it-the three steps you must take before you
start looking for licensing partners. "You want to be sure that your company
would be considered the author-or be sure you get the rights," advises
Auslander. You can't sell what you don't own, and having the right patent or
trademark registration will help you protect what you've created.

Intellectual property comes in many flavors, including trademarks, utility
patents, design patents and copyrights. Conceivably, one item could be
protected by a copyright, a trademark and a design patent. That's the good
news. The bad news is that each type of protection has different rights and
limitations, and they are not always complementary. A patent, for example, can
nullify the effect of a trademark, warns Auslander. That can be dangerous
because each type of protection has a different duration: A patent is the
shortest, a trademark exists only while you use it in the marketplace, and a
copyright is perpetual.

By now you're probably thinking that this sounds like a job for a lawyer.
You're right. Lawyers who specialize in intellectual property law can help you
protect your intellectual property and may also be a good first stop for
finding a licensee. CPAs and lawyers can help you find companies that need
your technology or design, says CPA Larry Weiner of [Weiner, Dailey & Co.
LLC](http://www.wdcocpas.com) in Elmsford, New York.

If you're serious about a licensing strategy, consider speaking with both a
lawyer and a CPA, says Weiner. "Where a lawyer would be looking at your
[intellectual property] from a legal point of view, a CPA can help you
maximize the strategic and economic value," he says. Issues like how much to
charge for a license, whether to require minimum royalty payments, and how to
be sure your licensee is calculating royalties accurately are all issues for a
CPA or a financial advisor.

Every time you grant a license, you give up sales and profits you could have
pursued yourself. Of course, you can't be in every market with every possible
product, but you'll need to start with a clear strategy for segmenting the
marketing. Decide in advance what you can do-in Ambient's case, for example,
selling Orbs through consumer catalogs-and what you can't. For the
opportunities you can't or don't want to pursue, look for a strong licensing
partner.

Licenses, both exclusive and nonexclusive, allow you to slice the pie any way
you want. Some common segmentation strategies include assigning rights within
geographic limits, within particular industry segments, or simply for use in a
single product line. "Where a piece of technology has multiple applications,
I'd license it for a particular use," suggests Weiner. Industry-specific
designs or trademarks, on the other hand, might be better suited to geographic
licenses.

Ambient divides its licensees into two broad categories: consumer electronics
and "other." Since the adoption of Ambient technology is still in its infancy-
but has such broad application-it's not difficult to manage the different
licenses, says Hyatt. "We haven't yet had a situation where an existing
company is going into the same market as another start-up."

Nonetheless, managing and monitoring licenses can become a complex and time-
consuming task. There will always be issues of compliance, reporting and
quality control. Quality is especially important, says Auslander, since poor
quality can lead to liability issues and could even cause you to lose
protection under trademark laws. "You may want to see a sample from each
manufacturing run or see [the licensees'] marketing and advertising for
approval," she says. Don't forget that you retain ultimate ownership of the
intellectual property, so any product or derivative should be marked with
something that protects your rights, such as TM, Â© or the patent number.

Weiner and Auslander agree that license agreements can go bad, so be prepared.
"Good fences make good neighbors," says Weiner. "We trust everybody-subject to
verification. Be prepared to audit the results annually." As a rule of thumb,
expect to pay about 1 percent of your revenues for a thorough audit by a CPA.

Is licensing a distraction? It absolutely can be. On the other hand, few other
aspects of your business hold such potential wealth. As Hyatt and the Ambient
team mined the value of their intellectual property, they found that licensing
partners provided not only financial capital, but also human and market
capital. Says Hyatt, "What I see is a lot of outside companies worrying about
this while we're not. It's only 5 percent of my time, but the licensee is
spending 100 percent of their time trying to make the product successful."
