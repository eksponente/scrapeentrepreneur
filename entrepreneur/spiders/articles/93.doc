Free Tech Seminars for Women and Minority Entrepreneurs

The number of firms owned by women and minorities is the fastest growing
business segment in our country--and, unfortunately, one of the least
technologically savvy. According to a recent study by the Urban Institute, up
to $200 billion in additional revenue could be generated if this exploding
segment of business owners learned to better utilize the technology they have.
And Task Force, a new team of IT industry leaders, elected officials and other
community organizations that was put together by Microsoft and the U.S.
Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency, is planning on
helping these businesses do just that.

In its first step to bridging the technology gap, the Task Force is hosting
free technology seminars in six different cities across the United States.
These interactive, live seminars will provide hands-on training and teach
practical skills such as building websites and utilizing other tools to expand
your business. Participants will be exposed to the best practices, develop a
better understanding of the latest technology, and increase your awareness of
the various software and hardware available.

In addition to the trainings and hands-on labs, seminars will also feature
partner pavilions housing local small-business support services and economic
development initiatives designed to connect participants to additional
assistance from local resources. The goal of the Task Force is to strengthen
the U.S. economy by enhancing the business potential of woman-owned and
minority-owned businesses.
