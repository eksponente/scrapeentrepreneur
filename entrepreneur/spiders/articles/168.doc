Shark Tank Star Daymond John Says Never Make This Common Mistake When Pitching Investors

If you’re lucky enough to strut down _Shark Tank_’s infamous hallway -- or to
pitch your startup in front of potential investors anywhere -- be confident,
not cocky and be ready to bare your warts, so to speak.

[Daymond John](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/daymond-john), the popular
startup pitch show’s resident branding expert, says pretending that your brand
is spotless, like it’s never seen hard times, is the fastest way to shoot your
pitch in the foot. And your chance at investor cash, too.

The serial investor and Shopify brand ambassador told Entrepreneur.com that
“sounding too perfect” is the biggest and most common mistake he sees
entrepreneurs make when they pitch their products and business concepts.
You’ll be more likely to score his venture dollars -- or any potential
investor’s -- if you suck it up and talk openly about the mistakes you’ve made
along the bumpy road of entrepreneurship, he says. Be real.

“Don’t make your pitch, or your brand backstory, sound all rosy because I
don’t care what brand you look at or how big they are now, all of us know that
times have not been great all of the time,” he says. “If you can’t come clean
and tell investors how and why you failed, that raises a red flag. They need
to see that you learned from it and came back stronger.”

John knows quite a bit about the “bad times”** **that can go hand-in-hand with
launching a fledgling brand. Times were anything but rosy for the former Red
Lobster waiter in the late 1980s and early 1990s, back when he was hustling
hand-sewn wool FUBU hats between shifts on the streets of Hollis, Queens.

Strapped for cash, John failed to successfully launch his inaugural hip-hop
fashion line three times. In 1992, he and his three co-founders finally got it
off the ground and, not long after, into the mainstream thanks to big
publicity boosts from rappers like LL Cool J** **and the late Notorious B.I.G.
FUBU was reborn as FB Legacy in 2010.

John is an open book about his business failures. If you tell the truth about
yours, even the ugly truth, he says investors will be more likely to believe
in you and to bet their money on your brand.
