School Ties

If you are a college graduate, chances are your alma mater has called _you_
asking for money. But have you ever called _them_ for money? If not, maybe
it's time to turn the tables and learn what the "U" can do for you.

Across the country, colleges and universities are recognizing the value of
entrepreneurship. Your alma mater might be able to help you learn fund-raising
skills or network with potential investors. The school may even be able to
finance your company.



**Go Bucks**  
The University of Michigan's Ross School of Business in Ann Arbor supports the
[Wolverine Venture Fund](http://www.zli.bus.umich.edu/wvf), a multimillion-
dollar effort co-managed by students, faculty and professional VC advisors.
Likewise, the University of Maryland in College Park helped launch the $20
million New [Markets Growth Fund](http://www.newmarketsfund.com/), which
leverages many of the school's resources into investments in the Maryland,
northern Virginia and Washington, DC, areas.

Taking this concept to the extreme is the University Venture Fund, which
recently announced that it has some $18 million to invest in new and growing
companies. The UVF pulls investors, student managers and portfolio companies
from four campuses: Brigham Young University, The University of Utah,
Westminster College and Wharton School of Business. Jared Hutchings, the
fund's managing director, says the fund will roll out offices at two more
schools in 2007.

Hutchings says the fund's key advantage is its deep ties to the university
communities and student bodies. "We don't mandate that capital go to alumni,"
he says. "But we certainly give preferential treatment to people associated
with the [universities]."

The on-campus presence of funds makes them more accessible than most
professionally managed funds. Entrepreneurs who can make it back to campus
will have no trouble finding someone from these funds' large teams of
managers. "The way you get preferential treatment [for your company] is that
we have students working in the fund, so presenting your ideas to these
students is the first step," advises Hutchings. "We like to think that if
there's anything happening on campus, we'll know about it."



**Network It**  
Of course, not every college supports a venture fund--most do not. But what
most schools do have is an on-campus entrepreneurship center where business
owners and would-be entrepreneurs can go for advice and contacts. For a list
of schools with these centers, check out the [National Consortium of
Entrepreneurship Centers](http://www.nationalconsortium.org/), housed at
Indiana University in Bloomington.

Balky Nair was an MBA student at The University of Utah in Salt Lake City when
he founded high-tech sensor designer [Emisense](http://www.emisense.com/)with
Ashok Joshi. During that time, Nair came across the University Venture Fund
and the university's Department of Technology Venture Development, which works
with local companies.

Currently, Nair is trying to raise $5 million for new manufacturing capacity,
and he continues to rely on his network at the university to keep him moving
in the right direction. "I'm closely connected with faculty and definitely use
them as a resource--mostly to bounce ideas off of and do reality checks," says
Nair, 35. "They scrutinized [my business and funding plan] in great detail."
Nair, who projects nearly $1 million in sales for 2006, credits his network at
the university with helping clarify the fundraising process and the viewpoints
of VCs.

Like Nair, Nate Thurgood, 26, found that the University of Utah had the right
outlets for fundraising. Even though he had been closely associated with the
UVF as a student, it was a college professor who introduced Thurgood to a VC
firm willing to fund [BelleHavens](http://www.bellehavens.com/), a luxury
destination club in Salt Lake City that needed substantial cash to acquire
vacation properties around the world. With the VC's financial support,
Thurgood took on the project as co-founder and vice president of strategy. "A
lot of professors are well-connected in the business community," says
Thurgood, who projects sales between $5 million and $10 million for 2006. "The
more prestigious the school, the more connected [it is]. But even at smaller
schools, there are professors who can link you up with angels or institutional
money."



**Get Educated**  
Stanford University, a longtime leader in entrepreneurship and technology, is
well-connected among VCs and high-net-worth investors in Silicon Valley. Now,
anyone can leverage those relationships to learn fundraising secrets by
browsing [Stanford's "Educators Corner"](http://edcorner.stanford.edu/),
offering full-length audio recordings, short video clips and volumes of PDF
case studies from the area's business leaders. The video lessons from VCs and
high-growth entrepreneurs are especially valuable. Currently available on the
site are monologues from visionaries like Guy Kawasaki of Garage.com and Larry
Page of Google, plus VC stars like Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson and
Heidi Roizen of Mobius Venture Capital.

"If someone's interested in raising money, they can get these words of wisdom
from people who have been there," says Tina Seelig, executive director of the
Stanford Technology Ventures Program. Part of the School of Engineering,
Seelig's department is responsible for organizing guest lecturers, recording
their speeches and archiving the files online. "We have had 400,000 podcasts
downloaded this year," she says.

Stanford also offers continuing education courses and free public resources to
help entrepreneurs understand fundraising. Says Seelig, "They'll go out
looking for money much better prepared."



**Back to School**  
These days, schools understand the vital and interconnected roles investors
and entrepreneurs play and are offering continuing education classes, library
resources, business plan competitions, incubators and an array of advisors. In
the end, going back to school might pay off like never before.
