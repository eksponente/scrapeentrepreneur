Catch Your Cash

Think fast-name the three things most important to the success of your
business.

If cash management didn't make your list, you're not alone. Most entrepreneurs
think a lot more about sales and marketing than the specifics of managing
cash.

And really, who could blame them? The term "cash management" is broadly enough
defined so as to be perpetually misunderstood. "People have a hard time
describing it," says Joe Scharfenberger, head of small-business financial
services for Chase Regional Banking in New York City. "But cash management is
nothing more than cash in, cash accumulated and cash out."

Sounds simple enough. Yet many business owners watch their would-be-profitable
companies teeter on the brink because they don't have a handle on what's
coming in and what's going out of their corporate coffers. "Maybe, because
these things are basic, [business owners] assume they're being done; but there
are always surprises," says , CFO partner with professional services firm
Tatum Partners LLP in Chicago.

To help minimize surprises, assume no cash issue is too basic. Here's a
checklist to help keep you on track:

1\. Know where you are and where you're going. All good cash management begins
with a thorough assessment of your business's current cash position and the
development of a forecast based on that, says Jonathan Gassman, a partner with
accounting firm [Gassman & Golodny LLP](http://www.gassmangolodny.com) in New
York City. This should tell you whether receivables are being collected
quickly enough to pay vendors on time and whether you're optimizing your
float.

2\. Analyze accounts receivable and payable. If a cash position analysis turns
up more cash out than cash in, the best place to start is receivables. Zorko
looks at receivables first when he comes into a company to help with financial
troubles. Usually, he finds customers aren't paying for reasons the
entrepreneur had no knowledge of. Says Zorko, "It leads to a discussion about
product quality, service delivery or other things not being done properly."

A glance at receivables may also remind you that you've been shy about
collecting, says Ira Davidson, director of the [Small Business Development
Center](http://www.nyssbdc.org/centers/centers.cfm?centid=21) at Pace
University in New York City. Davidson counseled one business owner who showed
him nine months' worth of uncollected receivables. "He was afraid to collect
because they might not pay and he'd lose customers," says Davidson. Collecting
on time and sticking to credit policies are critical to keeping the money
flowing in.

Accounts payable analysis will tell you whether you're paying vendors too
early to capitalize on float. Zorko recommends asking, "Are we taking
advantage of payment discounts? Are we paying too soon?"

3\. Use your bank's tools. With an array of cash management tools available,
you never have to be in the dark again about your cash situation. "The biggest
mistake small-business owners make is using only a checking account to manage
cash," says Scharfenberger. He advises business owners to, at minimum, use an
interest-bearing money market account to park excess cash.

Gassman and Zorko both recommend limiting the number of accounts at different
banks. By consolidating accounts with one financial institution, you can also
negotiate more favorable loan terms.

4\. Get thee a good CFO. The first step on the way out of denial is admitting
that you'd much rather be out selling than crunching numbers-and then making
sure you have the right person to do that for you. Most entrepreneurs have
accountants, who tend to focus solely on tax minimization, or bookkeepers, who
may not have adequate training to handle more sophisticated corporate finance.
Says Davidson, "If [business owners] don't have a financial VP, they really
don't know the implications of what their cash on hand means to their business
at large."
