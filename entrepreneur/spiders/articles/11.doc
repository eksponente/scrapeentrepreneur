SBA Update

[Women entrepreneurs](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/185570) can tap into
a valuable source of knowledge, experience and one-on-one support through the
Women's Network for Entrepreneurial Training (WNET).

Developed by the SBA's Office of Women's Business Ownership, WNET matches
successful entrepreneurial women (mentors) with women business owners whose
companies are ready to grow (prot�g�es). Mentors and proteg�es meet regularly
over a one-year period, during which mentors guide the less experienced
entrepreneurs over the hurdles of growing a business.

Mentors must be women who have been in business for at least three years, have
demonstrated steady business growth, and have an average of four hours per
month to spend with a prot�g�e for at least one year. Prot�g�es must be women
who have been in business at least one year, must demonstrate that they have
strong entrepreneurial skills, and must be willing to spend at least four
hours per month with a mentor and apply the knowledge gained.

For more information on how you can participate in WNET, call (202) 205-6673
or (800) 8-ASK-SBA.
