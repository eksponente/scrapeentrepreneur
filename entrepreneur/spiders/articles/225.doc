The ABCs of Schedule Cs

For many businesses, January 1 marks the start of a new tax year. And while
few, if any, people attend parties on December 31 to yell out "Happy New Tax
Year," businesses should nonetheless be prepared to face the tax options
offered when the clock strikes twelve. Because the start of a new tax year
should be a time to reconsider your business tax strategies.

One of the more important tax questions business owners may want to ask
themselves is this: Do I want to continue to file my businesses taxes using
the IRS' Schedule C?

As many small-business owners know, people who operate their businesses as
individuals are doing business as "sole proprietors" or "self-employed
persons." When filing their annual tax returns with IRS, sole proprietors are
required to list their business income and business expenses on a Schedule C,
or possibly a Schedule C-EZ, of their individual tax returns, the famous IRS
form 1040.

If you're currently filing a Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ, here are a few
considerations that may help you decide whether you and your business want "to
C or not to C" in the future:

Using a Schedule C or C-EZ for your business can be easier, faster and less
expensive than having to file a corporate or other type of business tax
return. You can generally prepare them yourself, without the added time and
expense of hiring a tax professional to do it for you.

What's even better is that beginning with this tax-filing season, the limit on
business expenses for sole proprietors using a Schedule C-EZ has been
increased from $2,500 to $5,000. The IRS estimates that this change will allow
500,000 more businesses to use a Schedule C-EZ, thus saving taxpayers 5
million hours of paperwork.

Not everyone, however, can file a Schedule C-EZ. To be eligible to file a
Schedule C-EZ, you cannot carry any inventory in your business, you cannot
have a business loss (only a profit), you cannot hire an employee for your
business, and you cannot claim expenses for the business use of your home,
among other restrictions.

So why would any business owner want to consider changing their business
structure and not file a Schedule C?

Perhaps the main reason is, numerous tax experts believe that persons who file
a Schedule C as part of their 1040 form have a much higher chance of being
audited by the IRS, particularly when the Schedule C contains a deduction for
a home office or the income noted and expenses claimed on the Schedule C are
significant dollar amounts.

While good record keeping, combined with obtaining solid tax advice, will
allow you to successfully defend yourself in an audit, they can be time
consuming, expensive--if you hire that tax professional to advise you--and
nerve-wracking experiences that most people would rather not have to deal
with.

In addition, if you're doing business as a sole proprietor or an
"unincorporated business"--and therefore must file a Schedule C--from a legal
standpoint, you have unlimited personal liability for anything that goes wrong
in your business. That means not only can your business income and assets be
in danger but so can your personal assets.

Fortunately, a relatively easy and practical way to guard against having
unlimited personal liability is change the form under which you operate your
business to either a corporation or a limited liability company (LLC). You
would then no longer file your business taxes on a Schedule C, but rather by
using the proper forms for a corporation or LLC.

But what if you like the ease of filing a Schedule C for your business taxes
yet still want to guard against unlimited personal liability? If that's your
goal, then perhaps the best solution for you is to form a single-member LLC.
Using this format, the IRS will generally require that you record your
business revenues and expenses on a Schedule C of your personal 1040.

Not sure what to do next? With several options available to you--and numerous
tax, legal and practical considerations to take into account--be sure to
review your particular situation with your tax professional or business
attorney before making any changes so you can be sure you're making the right
decision for you and your business.
