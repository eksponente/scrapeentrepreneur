How To Find Expansion Financing

You can't grow unless you have money to invest in growth. That may seem
strange at first. After all, growth is supposed to generate additional sales
and profits, right? That's true, but before you can increase sales, you
usually have to increase your current assets, such as inventory and fixed
assets such as a plant and equipment. Rapid growth means hiring more people,
furnishing more offices and perhaps renting new quarters. Since there's
usually a time lag between the moment you need to invest in growth and the
moment you receive the resulting sales and profits, you need money before you
can grow.

Financing expansion can take many forms. You can use your own money, borrow
from friends and family, use internally generated funds, approach equity
investors or tap banks and other lenders. The sources for funding growth are
generally the same sources you may have used to start your business. In many
cases, you'll go back to the same sources to pay for expanding your company.
The good news is that it's easier to fund growth in an existing business than
it is to fund a startup.

#### Types of Expansion Financing

As you learned when you were looking for startup capital, there are many
places to go when seeking money for business. As you probably also learned,
only a few of those places are right for any given business. Selecting the
right type of expansion financing is largely a matter of matching your needs
to the restrictions of the source. Each type of financing has its own
strengths and limitations.

#### Personal Sources

Self-financing in the form of personal and family savings is the No. 1 form of
financing used by most small-business owners. It's low-cost and has other
advantages. For instance, when you approach other financing sources, such as
bankers and venture capitalists, they'll want to know exactly how much of your
own money you are putting into the venture. After all, if you don't have
enough faith in your business to risk your own money, why should anyone else
risk theirs?

Here are some of the sources of personal and family financing you should
consider for growing your business:

  * **Personal line of credit, including credit cards:** Although credit card financing is expensive, it can work for emergencies and small amounts.
  * **Home equity loan secured by your personal residence:** Interest rates are low, but you may lose your home if you can't repay.
  * **Cash-value life insurance:** Interest rates are reasonable on loans against cash-value policies, and you don't have to make payments because the loan will be repaid from proceeds of your insurance in the event of your death.
  * **Individual retirement account (IRA) funds:** Laws governing IRAs let you withdraw money from an IRA as long as you replace it within 60 days. It's not a loan, so there's no interest, but if you pay it back late, you'll have to pay a 10 percent penalty plus taxes.

#### "Friends and Family" Financing

Friends, relatives and business associates are popular sources for financing
the growth of small businesses. There are two main advantages to friends and
family financing.The all-important issue of the character of the borrower is
moot--these people already know you. Depending on who you're borrowing from,
repayment terms may be extremely flexible, and you may not even have to pay
interest.

The downside is that, if worst comes to worst and you can't repay the loan,
the people who will be hurt will be friends, family and business associates.
Make sure you explain the risks involved in investing in a growth business
before accepting financing from friends and family. Otherwise, their wish to
help you out may lead them to do something that could damage your personal
relationship as well as your mutual finances.

#### Internally Generated Funds

One of the most advantageous ways to finance growth is through earnings your
business is creating and that you retain. The only cost to using retained
earnings is the interest you would receive if you kept the earnings in a bank
account. Since this amount is likely to be much less than you will earn by
successfully investing the funds in growing your business, plowing retained
earnings back into your business is usually a smart move.

One risk to financing with internally generated funds is that you will divert
too much of your current profits into expanding the business. This can starve
your business and create more trouble than if you financed with a more costly
source or never tried to grow at all. Make sure you aren't robbing Peter to
pay Paul when you finance with retained earnings, and that your investments in
inventories, marketing efforts, production staff and other outlays required
for the existing business are maintained.
