Something Old/Something New

At first, Tyco's Tickle Me Elmo seemed like an ordinary toy. But shortly after
its release, the giggling plush Muppet from _Sesame Street_ became immensely
popular, selling out at toy stores faster than Bert could get annoyed with
Ernie. When Christmas-season laws of supply and demand caused prices to
skyrocket into the hundreds of dollars for each toy, those who had Tickle Me
Elmo dolls to sell considered themselves lucky. Those who didn't, wished they
had.

Few things skyrocket in price like the Tickle Me Elmo dolls. But interest in
antiques and collectibles is high. If you've caught collecting fever, whether
for primitive furniture, decorative items, jewelry or even modern fast-food
kids' meal toys, selling collectibles or antiques just may be your ticket to
business ownership.

Although there are numerous ways to sell antiques and collectibles, one of the
most popular is through an antique mall or co-op.
