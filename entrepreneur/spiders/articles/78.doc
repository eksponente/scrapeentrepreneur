Biggest Tech Companies Team Up to Object to Government Spying

The Big Six of the Internet are taking on Big Government over privacy.

AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo teamed up in a letter to
Congress to push for a dramatic scaling back of government-surveillance
programs. The letter was sent a day after it was disclosed that the National
Security Agency had[ tapped fiber-optic lines of Google and
Yahoo](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/technology/nsa-is-mining-google-and-
yahoo-abroad.html?_r=0) as part of its spying efforts overseas.

The initial concerns voiced by the companies are for the optics of the
controversy. They express frustration over the “confusion” government
surveillance causes in the marketplace, and the “erroneous reports” that the
companies allowed the government access to directly access their servers.

But the companies also make a direct appeal for reining in surveillance
programs overall, in the interest in protecting rights.

“Our companies believe that government surveillance practices should also be
reformed to include substantial enhancements to privacy protections and
appropriate oversight and accountability mechanisms for those programs,” the
company wrote.

The letter mentions one proposed law under consideration, the USA Freedom Act,
though it stops short of a full endorsement. The bipartisan Freedom Act [would
amend both the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-31/usa-freedom-act-would-
leash-the-national-security-agency) to prevent the NSA from bulk collection of
Americans' communications records. It also would create an advocate to the
FISA court, where surveillance requests are made, to ensure civil liberties
and allow for faster appeals of decisions by that secret court.

Technology companies affected by government surveillance have long complained
that they are prohibited from disclosing requests for information from the
federal government. Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer even went so far as
saying that company disclosures of such requests [amounted to
treason](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/228351).

The USA Freedom Act would allow companies to disclose more general information
about government requests and subpoenas.

But while the USA Freedom Act has support from both parties, it also faces
bipartisan opposition, so the chances of passage in either the House or the
Senate remain unclear.
