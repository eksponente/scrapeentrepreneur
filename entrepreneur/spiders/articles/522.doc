Cost-Cutting Strategies for Your Home Business

With mounting energy bills eating into everyone's income and increasing the
cost of doing business at home, it's a good time to look into ways to
economize your home business. First we'll take a look at some ways to keep
your energy costs in line, followed by some other ways to cut corners and
save.

1\. Cut Utility Bills  
Now is a good time to compare the choices you have for providing heat and
electricity in your home office. First, you may find immediate cost savings by
switching from a conventional system to an alternative one like cutting down
the energy demands on your furnace by heating your home with your wood-burning
fireplace. In the summer, reduce air-conditioning costs by scheduling your
work around the hottest hours of the day, using attic fans and skylights that
open to let out the heat. Often you can do this without decreasing your
productivity.

If you use propane or heating oil and have a choice of suppliers, compare
prices. Find out if your home business qualifies for a business discount or
business rate. If you can get a business rate, make sure it's actually cheaper
than your residential rate. Some state utility commissions tilt in favor of
consumers, but many offer business discounts.

Some utility companies offer free energy evaluations where a certified
inspector will come to your home and assess your home and office energy-use.
The inspector will show you where you can save resources and money and offer
specific suggestions on how to do so. If a free inspection isn't available, it
may be worthwhile to hire an energy auditor. You can locate an energy expert
through the [Residential Energy Services Network
(RESNET)](http://www.natresnet.org/directory/rater_directory.asp).

You can calculate your home's energy use at

at [The American Council for an Energy-Efficient
Economy](http://www.aceee.org/index.htm). For a specific weatherization
assistance program, try [www.eere.energy.gov/weatherization](http://www.eere.e
nergy.gov/weatherization). Another information resource is [The American
Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy](http://www.aceee.org/).

2\. Make Your Home Energy-Efficient  
A number of home improvements now qualify for tax incentives provided in the
_Energy & Transportation Tax Acts_ of 2005. Beginning January 1, 2006, you can
recover up to 30 percent of the cost of solar water heaters and photovoltaic
equipment in the form of tax credits. There are also credits for adding
insulation or roof materials that'll reduce heat loss, as well as putting in
geothermal heating and central fan systems. To learn more, check with your tax
professional or get an overview at

To save on lighting, use compact fluorescent and halogen bulbs. They use less
energy, produce more light, and last longer than ordinary incandescent bulbs.
To find out if your existing office equipment and anything else that uses
electricity is being an energy hog, buy a device that enables you to monitor
energy usage. One such device is called Kill A Watt from [P3 International](ht
tp://www.p3international.com/products/special/P4400/P4400-CE.html).

When replacing equipment, look for office equipment that displays the Energy
Star logo. Using such equipment can cut your electric usage by as much as 50
percent over other equipment. Learn more about EPA's Energy Star program at
[www.energystar.gov](http://www.energystar.gov/). Replacing home appliances
over 10 years old is also something to consider.

3\. Get a Better Deal on Phone Services  
Increasing numbers of people are saving money by using voice over internet
protocol (VoIP), such as [Skype](http://www.skype.com/). While quality of
service varies, a friend of ours who lives outside the U.S. reports people
hear him better when he's using using Skype than when he's on his land line.
Other major VoIP providers are [iConnectHere](http://www.iconnecthere.com/),
[Net2Phone](http://www.net2phone.com/)and [DialPad](http://www.dialpad.com/).

You may also be able to save money on your cell-phone service. To get
customers to switch services, providers are constantly competing with each
other by offering lower prices. You can make a side-by-side comparison on
sites like [www.myrateplan.com](http://www.myrateplan.com/).

Another money-saving option is to combine your phone and internet services.
Check prices carefully, though. For example, we get SBC's bundling of local
and long-distance service, but we're required to pay for tacked-on services we
don't use. If you want to combine your phone and internet services, shop
around to make sure you're actually saving on a bundled package.

4\. Save on Office Supplies and Equipment  
If you need to replace old equipment or replenish dwindling supplies, there
are a number ways to cut costs.

  * **Comparison-shop smartly.** When buying office equipment, use shopping comparison sites, such as [www.streetprices.com](http://www.streetprices.com/), [www.Nexttag.com](http://www.nexttag.com/), [www.Shopzilla.com](http://www.shopzilla.com/), [www.Pricegrabber.com](http://www.pricegrabber.com/)and [www.froogle.com](http://www.froogle.com/). To get the best prices, check out multiple comparison sites for each purchase. Also check out prices on eBay as well as other auction sites like [Bidville](http://www.bidville.com/), [ePier](http://www.epier.com/), and [iOffer](http://www.ioffer.com/). Items on less-used auction sites sometimes fetch lower prices than ones on eBay, or offer alternatives to bidding.
  * **Buy in bulk.** Chances are you'll save by buying items you use a great deal of in bulk at warehouse stores like Costco. For supplies you use in your home business that aren't available at office superstores or warehouse stores, consider joining other homebusiness owners to buy items directly from a manufacturer.
  * **Buy generic store brands.** Office superstores offer private label items such as mailing labels, ink cartridges and shipping envelopes at discounts over name brands. Chances are they're made by the same manufacturers.
  * **Don't waste paper.** Save on the amount of paper you use in your home office by using: 
    * Personal information management software instead of making notes on paper,
    * The "print preview" feature in your word-processing or desktop publishing software to see what your printed page will look like before printing (this will reduce the number of test copies you'll need to make),
    * Your computer to send and receive faxed messages without having to produce printed pages,
    * Outdated stationery as notepads instead of throwing it away, and
    * Homemade packing material made from junk mail and other paper you normally discard that has been run through a paper shredder (also save shipping boxes, plastic foam balls, and other plastic packaging materials for reuse).

5\. Pay Credit Card Bills Soon After They Arrive  
Credit card companies will take as many as three days to log your payment, so
your best bet is to pay soon after receiving your bill if you have the money
in your account and can pay the balance in full. If you miss the closing date,
you'll be charged the larger of a late fee (often $39) or interest on the old
and new balance.

There are a number of ways you can cut costs and save money in your homebased
business. With minimal effort, these five strategies will put a little extra
money in your pocket now and add up to big savings for you and your business
year after year.
