Top 10 Car Technology Trends From CES 2010

The [Consumer Electronics Show](http://www.cesweb.org/) in Las Vegas each
January is where gadget makers gather to show off their latest gizmos, and in
the past few years CES has increasingly attracted automakers and suppliers who
introduce their tech innovations at the show alongside aftermarket companies.
And while CES is a showcase for products and features that we'll see in cars
and in stores within the next year, it also offers a glimpse at cutting-edge
technologies that are a little farther down the road.

There's no better place than CES to see what the short-term and long-term
future of car electronics holds for drivers. Here are 10 car tech trends we
identified at this year's show.

  1. **Smartphone Apps**  
CES 2010 may be remembered as the year automakers and suppliers went app
happy. Ford introduced innovative apps for its
[Sync](http://blogs.edmunds.com/strategies/2010/01/latest-generation-of-ford-
sync-to-feature-twitter-interface.html) system that allow access to Twitter
feeds and other content in the car, while
[OnStar](http://www.onstar.com/us_english/jsp/index.jsp) showed an app for the
upcoming [Chevy Volt](http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/volt/review.html) that
lets owners check charging status, schedule charge times, remotely start the
car and more. And auto electronics suppliers such as Continental and Hughes
Telematics showed future-concept apps that allow you to do everything from
remotely checking tire pressure to analyzing emissions.

  2. **Pandora**  
CES 2010 was also the year that internet-radio service
[Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) came to the car in a big way through Ford's
Sync system and head units from Alpine and Pioneer. Each uses Pandora's
smartphone app to access the service and then pipe it into the car so it can
be safely controlled by the head unit or, in the case of Sync, via voice
controls. Radio was the first entertainment technology available in cars, and
while satellite radio offers more variety for a price and HD Radio provides
more features for free, Pandora offers the best of both worlds.

  3. **Easier Portable Device Integration**  
Automakers and aftermarket manufacturers know that for most drivers it's all
about how well their portable media and communications devices integrate into
a vehicle. Ford's Sync system continues to raise the bar by adding features
like the aforementioned apps for bringing content into cars. Kia introduced
its new [Uvo](http://blogs.edmunds.com/strategies/2010/01/tech-tuesdays-2010
-consumer-electronics-show-preview.html) system that runs on similar Microsoft
software and offers many of the same features and conveniences of Sync.
Meanwhile, aftermarket companies like Alpine, Kenwood and Pioneer continue to
roll out unique features that make using portables easier and safer while
behind the wheel.

  4. **Better Voice Controls**  
Sync also largely sets the standard in voice control for accessing content on
portable media players and using a mobile phone while behind the wheel, and
the system got an upgrade in the form of a "flatter" command sequencing,
meaning less structured and rigid input on the part of a driver. Kia's Uvo
system uses a new Microsoft-developed voice engine that makes it easier to say
what you want the system to do instead of having to remove your hands from the
wheel and your eyes from the road.

  5. **More Accurate Traffic**  
For many drivers, real-time traffic is still the missing piece of the
navigation puzzle: Existing systems can tell you where to go and how long it
will take to get there, but usually fall short on providing a detailed picture
of the traffic along the way. Inrix, a major supplier of traffic info, made
several announcements at the show that could help.  
  
The company is extending its coverage beyond major highways to surface streets
by March 2010, and its service will provide traffic info for the nav portion
of the new [MyFord Touch](http://blogs.edmunds.com/karl/2010/01/exclusive-
hands-on-preview-of-myford-touch-and-syncs-next-generation.html) system,
replacing Sirius Traffic. Finally, Inrix introduced a new and more extensive
iPhone app called Traffic Pro. This all means that with Inrix gathering data
from more users, an accurate picture of the traffic on your commute could
become much clearer.

  6. **More Detailed Maps**  
In the same way that traffic is becoming more comprehensive, nav system
mapping is getting more "granular." The two major map-data suppliers each
introduced innovations that will better help drivers find their way and also
add some safety. Navteq showed a new LIDAR-based data-gathering system that
goes Google Street View one better by providing detailed 3-D and 360-degree
renderings of areas. Tele Atlas announced new mapping software that can
provide details such as road curvature and grade percentage to potentially
help cars not only save fuel, but keep drivers and their passengers safer by
potentially alerting them to road features that could prove dangerous.

  7. **Aftermarket Camera Systems**  
In the same way that automakers have been muscling in on the aftermarket's
turf in audio, video and other areas, brands such as Alpine and Kenwood are
challenging the OEMs with cool new camera systems. Alpine showed a prototype
of a multicamera system that provides a 360-degree view similar to [Infiniti's
Around View Monitor](http://www.edmunds.com/ownership/safety/articles/153207/a
rticle.html), while Kenwood offers a tiny camera that can be hooked up to the
company's A/V head units to provide various wide-angled views in the rear or
front of a vehicle.

  8. **Disc-Less Head Units**  
This is a trend that Alpine created and has virtually owned in the last few
years. But at CES 2010, Pioneer and Kenwood both debuted "mech-less" head
units without a disc drive that are primarily used to control an iPod or other
portable media player.

  9. **Eco Routing**  
Even though gas prices have eased somewhat, drivers are increasingly fuel-
cost-conscious and many also want to monitor their carbon footprint. Garmin
introduced an upgrade to its ecoRoute software, called ecoRoute hd, that
allows the company's existing Nuvi portable nav systems to display diagnostic
and performance data obtained wirelessly through a vehicle's OBD II port.
[Pioneer](http://blogs.edmunds.com/strategies/2010/01/flagship-pioneer-head-
unit-features-pandora-auto-playlists-eco-routing.html) added a feature called
Eco Graph that lets a driver view and calculate in real-time the impact his
driving has on the environment.

  10. **The Connected Car**  
Cars that can connect to the internet--and therefore to our connected lives--
were a common theme at CES. The new MyFord Touch/Sync system allows you to
access the Web in a variety of ways. Suppliers such as Continental and Hughes
Telematics showed technology that will allow owners to monitor their vehicles
from anywhere in the world via a smartphone; receive RSS feeds in the car and
have them read using text-to-speech technology; get detailed restaurant
reviews and discounts; and customize their daily commutes using smart nav
routing.
