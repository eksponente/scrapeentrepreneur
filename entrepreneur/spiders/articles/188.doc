3 Student Startups That Are Going the Distance

Anyone who has made it through college knows that ideas are cheap. Every
conversation in the classroom, on the quad or at the coffee shop is littered
with them--some great, most awful. On occasion, the spitballing even spawns a
bit of short-lived business action (witness all the broken links on any Best
College Startups internet list from the past few years). o Clearly, it's not
just an awesome idea that makes a college startup great. It takes follow-
through, patience and business smarts to transform a dorm-room musing into a
viable business. Here are some college startups that made the leap from good
idea to great company.

## The perfect fix

In 2012, Spencer Quinn was a junior at Brigham Young University in Provo,
Utah, working a summer job at a company that sold athletic tape, when he heard
about a doctor who used medical casting tape to fix an all-terrain vehicle. It
was an "aha" moment for Quinn, a biotech major.

Along with his cousins Reed and Chris Quinn and brother-in-law Derek Rowley,
Quinn attempted to repair household items using casting tape. "I thought maybe
this stuff could fix more than bones, so we started putting it on broken
tools, leaky pipes and other stuff," he recalls. "It was not a good solution."

Those efforts didn't work, but the trio got to thinking about what elements
would make a better repair tape. The product would have to go beyond duct tape
to create a permanent bond, and it would need to be waterproof and able to
withstand impact and heavy loads.

They worked with the BYU mechanical engineering lab to find a solution. Once
they had a prototype, they took it to an adhesives manufacturer to work out
the production process. The result was FiberFix, which, after being soaked in
water and applied tightly, can permanently repair shovel handles, leaking
pipes and just about any other broken object.

But creating FiberFix was just the first step. "I think so many products fail
in the manufacturing and logistics stage," Quinn, now 25, explains. "You have
to learn how to approach big retail buyers and know how to execute your
product in such a way that you don't get chargebacks that kill the company.
After that first sale, 99 percent of the work is still ahead of you."

The team worked trade shows, demonstrating their miracle product to hardware
and construction experts, and entered their idea in competitions. They won
events at BYU and placed second in the International Business Model
Competition. But their biggest coup came in October 2013, when they were
featured on TV's Shark Tank, where they convinced judge Lori Greiner to invest
in their concept.

That led to multiple stints on QVC, where they sold 45,000 rolls of FiberFix
in 10 minutes. The product is now carried at 10,000 retail locations,
including Home Depot and Lowe's. More than 1.3 million rolls of FiberFix have
been sold at $6 to $10 each.

Despite the success, Quinn and his business partners are dedicated to
finishing their education, though on a more relaxed schedule.

"I was initially nervous that I wouldn't get enough support from my professors
to do both things, but I haven't found a single one that wasn't excited about
the opportunity and supported us," says Quinn, who hopes to expand the
FiberFix product line over the next three to five years before selling the
company. "BYU has lots of entrepreneurs and great talent. I think everyone
here likes a good success story and wants to be a part of it in some way."

## Let's go to the tape

Lindsay Stewart was a TV news producer in Los Angeles before enrolling at the
Wharton School's San Francisco campus in 2012. The idea was to get a few
letters behind her name to help make her way up the ladder on the management
side of the media business.

In one of her classes, students were asked to pitch a business idea. For
several years, Stewart had been thinking about the inefficient ways news
outlets acquire video footage. Deadline-focused assignment editors are often
forced to buy tape sight-unseen from third-party stringers; at times they even
contact people through YouTube. News stations go to air with whatever images
they can find, good or bad. On the flip side, Stewart knew great photographers
and videographers who missed out on work because they had no way to
communicate directly with editors. And the payment process was equally slow
and messy.

When she proposed her idea of an online exchange where editors could view and
purchase news footage, and photographers (and the public) could show their
work and find assignments, her classmates were intrigued. But it wasn't until
fellow student Brian McNeill filled her Dropbox with plans and calculations
that she realized her concept, which she dubbed Stringr, could be a viable
business.

"It was having someone throwing their weight behind my idea that was the
genesis of Stringr," Stewart says. "You can go to the best business-school
program, but it's not so much about the academics as it is who sits next to
you. Classmates helped write the business plan and build the tech stack. They
gave me all that human capital for free, and that's what helped us launch
Stringr."

Through the rest of their time at Wharton, Stewart and McNeill, both of whom
graduated in May, refined their concept. They're now based at the San
Francisco media accelerator Matter, where they have five engineers on
contract. Stringr, which launched a three-month pilot in the San Diego news
market in August, plans to roll out to several more pilot cities before
expanding to newsrooms around the country.

Unlike other college entrepreneurs, who often have nothing to lose, Stewart,
34, and McNeill, 37, are taking big mid-career gambles with their startup. "I
think doing something like this is totally different than when you're
younger," Stewart says. "There are more risks--I sold my house to do this; I'm
not taking a salary. But my contacts are wider and deeper; I'm able to
navigate and sell to bigger companies. I'm not a 19-year-old selling a pipe
dream."

McNeill, who tried to start a tech company during the dot-com boom of the late
1990s, agrees that things are different this time around. "Without a network
or capital to get you down those first 50 yards, starting a business is
extremely difficult," he says. "At the same time, the opportunity loss is
high. I walked away from a partner-track job at Ernst & Young. But leaving
that behind has given me more confidence in what we're doing."

The founders agree that their entrepreneurship classes helped them clarify
their once-hazy expectations. "One of our professors ended our class by giving
us the stats on our education and experience," Stewart says. "He said less
than 1 percent of the population was as prepared as [we were] to start a
business, and he ended by saying he hoped we would try. That was very
inspiring. This is not just an idea for me. I feel passionate about it."

## A global cure

For all the debate about healthcare in the U.S., it's easy to lose sight of
the fundamental problems plaguing medical systems in other parts of the world.
In developing countries, people often die from lack of basic medicines, blood
or operable surgical equipment.

During one of her first classes at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,
chemical engineering major Carolyn Yarina stumbled upon this reality. Assigned
an open-ended engineering challenge, Yarina turned to a campus club that had
recently surveyed rural health workers. One of the needs in Africa, the survey
found, was a centrifuge that could run without electricity, allowing
clinicians to diagnose and treat diseases in areas without power.

Yarina took on the challenge, and by the end of the semester she and a team of
students created a human-powered centrifuge built from bicycle parts. It was a
neat engineering feat, and Yarina didn't want the idea to die with the end of
the class. So she created a student group called CentriCycle to continue work
on the project. She also enrolled in entrepreneurship classes, including a
practicum in social entrepreneurship, which convinced her to go to India for
the first time.

"I learned a lot on that trip, which led to a lot of changes," she recalls. "I
realized what they needed on the ground, and using a bicycle was not the best
idea."

Returning to India over the next two summers, she refined her concept and
developed contacts. After graduating in 2013, she worked on her centrifuge
full time, eventually developing a portable machine dubbed (r)Evolve that can
alternate between manual power and electricity. She also lined up engineering
and manufacturing support in India.

But it dawned on Yarina that she needed to go further. "Once I created our
student organization and started going to business classes, I had an
epiphany," she says. "Open-source designs are not a viable option if you
actually want to get your product out there. If it was just about creating a
process to separate blood, we would have been done four years ago."

Early this year, she and CentriCycle member Katie Kirsch teamed up with
another University of Michigan grad, Gillian Henker, who is developing
Hemafuse, an auto-transfusion pump for blood. Together, they started Sisu
Global Health, a socially conscious for-profit company, as a platform to
deliver medical products designed specifically for the needs of developing
countries. The centrifuge and auto-transfusion pump are their first two
offerings.

"Eighty percent of medical products are designed for 10 percent of the world,"
Yarina explains. "Designing for that other 90 percent is what we want to do."

The 24-year-old says she never expected to be at the helm of a company, but
she's glad her life has taken this turn. "During freshman orientation they
took us on a tour of the Center for Entrepreneurship. I remember I couldn't
wait to get out of there," she says. "I never thought I'd do anything with
entrepreneurship. After learning how to turn this idea into something that
could impact people's lives, I've realized entrepreneurship can be more about
making an impact than making money."
