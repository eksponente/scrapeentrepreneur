Simple Ways to Make Driving Easier

If the prospect of acquiring an almost-new vehicle on a short-term lease
(typically 18 to 24 months) with no down payment sounds enticing, look to
sites such as [Swapalease.com](http://www.swapalease.com/), [LeaseTrader.com
](http://www.leasetrader.com/)and
[TakeMyPayments.com](http://takemypayments.com/). These online clearinghouses
provide a platform to negotiate directly with lease owners who are motivated
to shed their cars.

OK, you've got your vehicle. When trying to get from A to B in the most
efficient way, check out Waze, a free, crowdsourced traffic and navigation
smartphone app for iOS and Android. Fed by info from a network of some 50
million U.S. drivers, Waze offers real-time reports on traffic, accidents,
construction zones and road hazards. It also locates the cheapest fuel prices
along a given route.

When you're working on the road, the IRS generously lets you write off 55
cents for each mile driven. But tracking those miles can be a pain. That's
where the [Milelogr app](https://www.milelogr.com/) ($2.99) comes in. It syncs
with your desktop calendar's appointment list, attaching mileage numbers to
off-site appointments and trips, to automatically create exportable Excel
spreadsheet files tailored specifically for tax returns.
