Looking For Funding?

A great source for finding funding for your growing firm is a venture forum. A
typical venue will bring together 150 to 500 people interested in talking
about start-up business plans, strategic partnerships, funding ideas,
managerial talent, technology transfer and referrals to any of the previous.
Business cards are exchanged throughout the event, phone numbers noted,
contacts made and follow-up appointments scheduled.

Venture forums take place across the United States on a monthly basis. In
California, for instance, there are seven "must see" forums to attend each
year between San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area. The typical arrangement
pairs a local college or university with sponsors from eight to 10 small-
business consulting organizations, merchant banks, venture capital groups and
small-business development agencies, as well as a Big Five accounting firm and
perhaps a securities underwriter.

Here's how a typical venture forum goes: Each May, my school, Westmont College
in Santa Barbara, California, co-sponsors the [Central Coast Venture
Forum](http://www.ccvf.org) along with Silicon Valley Bank,
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Southern California Edison. More than 100 invited--
as well as unsolicited--business plans make it to the selection committee
during the five- to six-month screening process that begins the previous fall.
The 24 best companies are then showcased at the one-day forum.

The morning typically starts with several panels of experts in finance,
marketing and operations discussing growth strategies. The program notes all
those in attendance (the real money), what types of business opportunities
they're looking for and how to be sure your firm is "deal-ready;" the two
dozen emerging-growth companies are also summarized in the program prospectus.
After the opening panels, the entrepreneurs from the top 10 firms get to tell
their stories during plenary sessions in the main conference hall. They
present their growth potentials and capital needs while the audience busily
takes notes.

At lunch, personal introductions occur, further discussions ensue and initial
relationships are forged. After that, founding entrepreneurs and senior
managers set up their firms' pitches to investors in separate "break-out"
rooms throughout the conference center and spend the rest of the afternoon
answering questions and interacting with serious investors who want more
company information.

Even if you're not selected for a formal presentation at a venture forum, you
should still show up with plenty of copies of the executive summary from your
business plan. A typical venture forum involves about seven hours of
networking, referrals, pagers, cell phones, PCs and impromptu conferences in
the hallways and at lunch, so be ready to tell the short version of your
company's story, plans for growth and the investment opportunity.

Many funding deals are set in motion (and some are even agreed to in
principle) on the day of the forum. Some investors may be ready to shake on a
deal's basic concept and then schedule follow-up meetings.

Regular attendance at the top venture forums is a great way to regularly seek
active investors. If you're looking for growth capital, a $100 to $400 entry
fee and seven hours of your time is by far one of the best investments you can
make in your company.
