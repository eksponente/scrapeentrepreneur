10 Lies VCs Know You're Telling

As a venture capitalist, I get pitched dozens of times every year, and every
pitch contains at least three or four of the lies below. Are you guilty?

**1\. "Our projections are conservative."** An entrepreneur's projections are never conservative. If they were, they would be $0. I have never seen an entrepreneur achieve even their most conservative projections. As a rule of thumb, when I see a projection, I add one year to delivery time and multiply by 0.1.

**2\. "(Big-name research firm) says our market will be $50 billion in 2010."** Even if the product is bar mitzvah planning software, every entrepreneur claims the market potential is tens of billions. Do yourself a favor: Remove any reference to market size estimates.

**3\. "(Big-name company) is going to sign our purchase order next week."** Only play this card _after_ the purchase order is signed, because no investor will fall for this one.

**4\. "Key employees are set to join us as soon as we get funded."** When a venture capitalist calls these key employees, he usually gets the following response: "I recall meeting him, but I certainly didn't say I would leave my $250,000-a-year job to join his company." If key employees _are_ ready to rock 'n' roll, have them call the venture capitalist and confirm it.

**5\. "No one else is doing what we're doing."** Well, either there's no market for it, or you're so clueless that you can't use Google to figure out you have competition. Neither a lack of a market nor cluelessness is conducive to securing an investment.

**6\. "No one else can do what we're doing."** The only thing worse than cluelessness and the lack of a market is arrogance.

**7\. "Hurry, because several other vc firms are interested."** There are maybe 100 entrepreneurs in the world who can make this claim. The fact that you're reading this article means you're not one of them.

**8\. "Oracle is too big/dumb/slow to be a threat to us."** There's a reason Larry Ellison is where he is, and it's not that he's big, dumb and slow. Entrepreneurs who utter this lie look naive at best, stupid at worst.

**9\. "We have a proven management team."** If you were that proven, you wouldn't be asking for money. A better strategy: State that you have relevant experience, you'll do whatever it takes to succeed, you'll surround yourself with proven advisors and you'll step aside whenever it becomes necessary.

**10\. "All we have to do is get 1 percent of the market."** First, no venture capitalist is interested in a company that wants just 1 percent of a market. Second, it's not easy to get even 1 percent, so you look silly pretending it is. Instead, show an appreciation of the difficulty of building a successful company.
