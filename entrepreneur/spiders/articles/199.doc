Good Funds Gone Bad

The finer points of late trading and market timing might be lost on the
majority of mutual fund investors, even after months of scandal-bearing
headlines, but the bottom line is not: Namely, that big investors were given
breaks that hurt the little guy. Everybody can grasp that much, and securities
regulators and politicians are frothing at the mouth to hold fund houses
accountable. That's fine for them, but what should you do if you happen to
invest in a fund that's been publicly tarnished by the growing scandal?

After all, it's not as if a fund is going to become worthless the way Enron
Corp. shares did when the bottom fell out. A fund's net asset value (NAV) is
calculated daily by adding up the value of its investments and dividing by the
number of shares outstanding. Unless most of a fund's investments go bad all
at the same time, its NAV won't drop off a cliff no matter what its parent
company says or does.

Jordan E. Goodman, author of _[Reading Between the Lies: How to Detect Fraud
and Avoid Becoming a Victim of Wall Street's Next Scandal_](http://www.amazon.
com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0793169453/entrepreneur) (Dearborn Trade
Publishing), is still adamant that investors should sell shares in what he
calls "named funds." He says the fact that public pension funds and other
investors are pulling their money from scandal-tarnished funds will lead to
higher trade-related expenses, create taxable gains for shareholders left
behind, and divert managers' attention from day-to-day money management. "It's
going to be very disruptive to long-term shareholders," Goodman says. "There's
a reputation risk to the fund going forward, too, which could hurt in terms of
new talent and money coming in."

A problem with selling your shares willy-nilly, though, is that it could
trigger tax headaches. If you've held shares for less than a year, any capital
gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates up to 35 percent. Even longer-
term capital gains can nick you for 15 percent of your long-overdue market
winnings. Then, of course, there's the headache of figuring out what your tax
basis was in the first place.

If you don't face serious tax consequences, however, it's a no-brainer. Slowly
divest yourself of investments in fund companies that put their own profits
ahead of yours. Even if you do face tax complications, it might be time to
start trimming around the edges, transferring the least-painful blocks of
shares to fund companies with a clean record.

Next month, we'll talk about one alternative: separately managed accounts.
