A Perfect Match?

Entrepreneurs Ahmed and Reem Rahim recently took a significant first step in
the half-million-dollar expansion of their organic tea company, [Numi
Teas](http://www.numitea.com). The brother-and-sister team made their first-
ever fund-raising pitch to a group of potential investors at a venture fair in
Oakland, California, in April.

Their funding search thus far had been limited to the event's sponsor, a
matchmaking service called [Investors' Circle](http://www.investorscircle.net)
in Brookline, Massachusetts, that links socially responsible companies with
like-minded investors. Numi Teas, also in Oakland, California, was entering a
critical growth phase in its four-year history when it enlisted the help of
the intermediary to find capital for a new product launch, expand its
inventory, and triple the size of its office and warehouse space. Because of
their strong social component-not only is their tea organic and certified
kosher, but they also outsource some of their tea packaging to an organization
that employs disabled adults-the Rahims considered Investors' Circle an
obvious starting point after hearing about the matchmaker from other
entrepreneurs and their own financial advisor. "We thought it would be a great
fit to be a part of an investors' [network] that was looking to support
organic [products] and sustainability in the environment," explains Ahmed, 35.

The tea company, however, was just one of several at the fair vying for
investment dollars. Months after their presentation, the Rahims are still in
close contact with some of the participating investors, providing financial
projections for their company (valued at close to $4 million for 2003), in
hopes of brokering an eventual deal. "We know it takes time to build the
relationships and [for investors] to get to know the company," Ahmed concedes.
"We didn't have any expectations that it would happen overnight, but we're
hoping that it will happen in three to six months. But it could take a year or
two years."

**A Mixed Bag**  
Fortunately for the Rahims, they are braced for a potentially drawn-out and
difficult investor search, in contrast to others who are looking for a quick
fix, often at any cost. A growing number of companies looking for expansion
capital in a hurry are using intermediaries to identify potential investors.
Although matchmakers run the gamut from services that offer face time with
investors to Web sites that post business plans for companies seeking
investment, many have one thing in common-they're not cheap. A broker may
charge a $25,000 fee to locate investors, in addition to a percentage of the
funds raised. Investors' Circle, for one, charges $350 to circulate a business
summary and $400 to $800 to present at its venture fairs. While some
intermediaries can provide investor access and advice on important issues,
such as the size and direction of financing, others may be a waste of
resources. An entrepreneur's success often hinges on the finder's screening
process. In other words, does the intermediary have a rigorous selection
process, or does it take money from anyone regardless of funding prospects?

Despite the potential shortcomings, entrepreneurs tend to view intermediaries
as a useful way to find backers. Investors, on the other hand, prefer a
professional referral to a paid matchmaker. "Entrepreneurs have been told the
only way to get a venture capitalist's attention is through a personal
referral. They've interpreted that to mean any referral, including a paid
intermediary," says Dee Power, the co-author of _Inside Secrets to Venture
Capital_ (John Wiley & Sons) and _Attracting Capital From Angels_ (John Wiley
& Sons). "The venture capitalist is talking about an accountant, an attorney
or respected businesspeople."

Venture capitalists suggest networking, attending venture capital conferences
and direct contact by the entrepreneur for those who lack a referral contact,
according to a recent study conducted by Power. None of the venture
capitalists in the study proposed an online matching service. Using a
searchable venture capital database was seldom recommended, and introduction
through a paid intermediary was rarely encouraged.

"Something that turns us off is if the intermediary contacts us and says 'Hey,
I have this great [entrepreneur], and you need to meet him,'" says Dennis
Spice, founding partner of [Open Prairie Ventures](http://www.openprairie.com)
in Champaign, Illinois. "I'd rather the intermediary say [to the entrepreneur]
'Call Dennis Spice. He may be interested in your company.' Putting a wall
between me and the entrepreneur, I can guarantee that we won't look at that
plan."

**Great Expectations**  
Entrepreneurs are drawn to intermediaries for a couple of reasons. For
starters, entrepreneurs have to stay positive throughout the arduous fund-
raising process, and having an investor liaison can help cushion them from
negative blows, says Power. "Also, raising capital can be a full-time job.
[Entrepreneurs] believe there's some magic conduit to the money, and that the
intermediary has that conduit."

In reality, most entrepreneurs fail to attract investment, no matter how good
their industry connections, because their business plan simply isn't palatable
or their lack of CEO experience is a turnoff. "Those businesses are not going
to be successful under just about any circumstances in attracting an
investor," she says, "but they sign up for the [matching] service anyway."

Matchmakers, in turn, have to be careful not to give false hope, says Woody
Tasch, chairman of Investors' Circle. "Every entrepreneur thinks his or her
business is the most compelling thing in the world and that people should be
beating down their doors to invest," he explains. "We try carefully to say,
'It could be nothing; it could be $5 million. The odds are greater it will be
nothing than it will be $5 million.'"

His organization has a "very gentle" screening process to ensure entrepreneurs
meet social and environmental criteria and to check for financial quality.
About half are screened out at this stage; the remaining ones submit executive
summaries. From those, members select companies to present at investor events,
where entrepreneurs make a short presentation and interact with members. "The
baton gets tossed to the investors at that point," says Tasch. "It's not the
most efficient process in the world. It's an open investment platform and an
open investment marketplace."

If you want to try an online matchmaker, investigate whether it has a wide
range of investors interested in many business types and industries, says
Power. Additionally, the service should notify an investor when a company
matches its parameters "rather than just slapping the business plan on its Web
site," Power says. She knows of one Web site that uses public records to
identify high-net-worth individuals who qualify as accredited investors based
on home values. "It could be your grandmother," Power says. "That's the wrong
kind of service to go to."

An intermediary's track record is also crucial, says Seattle attorney Robert
Seidel, a partner at law firm [Cairncross &
Hempelmann](http://www.cairncross.com). Obtain a list of clients to assess
recent successes and failures. "You're going to write them a check at the
outset without any assurance, so you need to do your best to find someone who
has the best chance of succeeding," he urges.

And be wary of long-term exclusive relationships. "There can be nasty
situations where intermediaries and companies sign contracts for a significant
period where the intermediary will get paid for any financing raised," Seidel
emphasizes, "and it doesn't matter if they identified the investor or not."
