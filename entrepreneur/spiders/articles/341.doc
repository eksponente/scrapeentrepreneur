MLMers: Employees or Independent Contractors?

This time last year our economy was thriving. We heard stories about bonuses
and promotions, not layoffs and bankruptcies. But figuring whether you earned
money as an employee or independent contractor has taken on a dramatically new
meaning in Tax Time 2000 and beyond. The combination of workforce layoffs, a
spiraling growth of homebased businesses, industry's increasing reliance on
temporary and contract workers, and the insecurity of those who are
"traditional employees" have made more of us into entrepreneurs and contract
workers than ever before.

While the variety of homebased businesses is vast, this article focuses on one
form-multilevel-marketing programs. While much attention has focused on
legally questionable marketing practices by some of these firms, we hear
little about a much more important question facing anyone participating in an
MLM at tax time-MLM associates' employment classification or "status" when it
comes to calculating our taxes. The question of "Who's the boss at tax time?"
becomes extremely important for the IRS and, therefore, for you. The right
answer can determine whether you'll check the "refund" or "payment due" box on
your tax form this year. Not knowing the answer to this question can have
costly consequences for anyone involved with an MLM or other homebased
business.

**Employee Vs. Independent Contractor**

The issue became important after a recent legal case holding that anyone
signing on as an associate or distributor with a MLM organization is a
contractor, not an employee of that organization. If you joined an MLM during
the past few years, your contract most likely states that you signed up as an
independent contractor and aren't an employee of that particular MLM program.

Therefore, if you're among the thousands of folks who became used to the
traditional working world of receiving and filing W-2 forms to calculate and
report your taxes, you need to be extra careful. Don't be surprised if you
received a 1099 Form from an MLM you may have been associated with in the
past. Many of these firms have changed their accounting systems to comply with
the law-and are sending all their current and prior associates and
distributors 1099's.

**Misclassification Can Pose Costly Risks**

Risks of employee misclassification face employers in all sectors, from
corporate giants like Microsoft which paid $97 million to settle a class
action lawsuits with misclassified "permatemps" last year to public
municipalities like King County, Washington, which paid $23 million to
misclassified workers.

A recent study by [The Independent Contractor
Report](http://www.workerstatus.com/) of the businesses and industries most
often involved in IRS-related worker status or misclassification disputes
confirmed the diversity of the problem. It included professionals and small-
business owners, clerical workers, doctors and nurses, personal care
assistants, truck drivers, newspaper delivery messengers and many more in
hundreds of workforce categories. Surprisingly (to some), lawyers and
accountants were at the top of the list.

**Questions To Ask**

As you do your taxes this year, ask yourself two simple questions: 1) Did I
spend all or part of the year as an independent contractor, temporary,
contract, part-time or other "nontraditional" worker?, and 2) Did I spend any
part of the year operating a small business of any size? This includes
participation in any multilevel or network marketing firm as an associate,
distributor or other label.

If you answer "yes" to either question, you may want to consider seeking
professional advice from a knowledgeable attorney and/or accountant to help
you in your calculations and avoid the high price of filing your tax forms
incorrectly.

The IRS and our courts continue to use the "[20 Common Law Factors
Test](http://www.contingentlaw.com/IRS20.htm)" to decide if you're an employee
or independent contractor. You can also find it, along with other useful
information to help you determine your tax status at the [IRS Web
site](http://www.irs.gov).

_Author's Note: This article is intended to inform and educate you, but not
answer your specific questions or deal with your particular situation. Bring
it with you to your accountant, lawyer or other professional tax or financial
advisor and ask how to avoid potential pitfalls of employee-contractor
misclassification._
