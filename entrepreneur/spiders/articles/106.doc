Do The Right Thing

_Because we believe the subject matter is so important, Entrepreneur Media is
running the following article, examining the question of ethics for small
business, in three of our publications: Entrepreneur, Business Start-Ups and
Entrepreneur's HomeOffice._

Charlie Wilson is trying to run an ethical business. He's made social
responsibility part of the mission statement at his $1.6 million Houston-based
salvage company, SeaRail International Inc. And he's made "self-actualization"
--not wealth--his ultimate goal as an entrepreneur.

But don't mistake Wilson for some moralistic stick-in-the-mud. It's all about
success. "Ethics is what's spearheading our growth," says Wilson. "It creates
an element of trust, familiarity and predictability in the business. We're in
an industry where a lot of people cut corners. I just don't think that's good
for business. You don't get a good reputation doing things that way. And
eventually, customers don't want to do business with you."

For years, ethics and business had a rocky marriage. Ask entrepreneurs to talk
about ethics, and the responses ranged from scorn to ridicule. Here are folks
who--by definition--like breaking the rules. Suggesting that entrepreneurs
should follow a predefined set of edicts was about as popular as asking them
to swear off electricity.

But this may be changing. Whether people are hung over from the freewheeling
'80s or reflective about the coming millennium, talk about values, integrity
and responsibility is not only becoming acceptable in the business community,
it's almost required.

"This looks just like the quality movement of 20 years ago," says Frank
Walker, chairman of Indianapolis-based Walker Information Inc., a research and
consulting company that tracks customer satisfaction and business ethics.
"Customers need a way to differentiate one firm from another." For years, the
dominant point of differentiation has been quality. Now, says Walker,
"Everyone can deliver quality, [ so businesses] need to step up to a higher
plane."

Are the nation's entrepreneurs ready to ascend to new heights of ethical
literacy and compliance? Well, sort of. Although most entrepreneurs still
aren't trying to unseat the likes of Socrates and Plato, many are giving
considerable thought to improving their ethics, with hopes that doing good
business will be good for business as well.
