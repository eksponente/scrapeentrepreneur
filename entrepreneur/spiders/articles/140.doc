Choosing a location for your salon/spa is one of those important decisions
you’ll make in the early stages of establishing your new business. Obviously,
you’ll want to locate it in an area that’s easily accessible by highway or
byway, with plenty of traffic (both foot and the four-wheeled variety) and
parking. The surrounding area should be attractive, well-lit, and safe. There
should also be other retail businesses nearby (as opposed to parks or a
regional airport) because they can generate business for you as they attract
customers through their own doors.

Typically, salons operate out of three types of establishments: freestanding
buildings, storefront properties, and shopping centers like strip malls.
Occasionally, salons are located in malls, but it’s actually more common for
them to operate out of a free-standing building located on the perimeter or an
“outlot” of the mall property because the rent is so high inside the mall.
They’re also sometimes found on the ground floor of office buildings in large
metropolitan areas where there’s a significant amount of foot traffic during
the business day. However, such locations may not be optimal if they’re in an
urban area that doesn’t have much traffic in the evenings or on weekends.

Your choice of location will be driven not only by the amount of startup
funding you have but by the size of the facility you want to have, the
availability of space in the city where you want to do business, the local
competition, and your tolerance for building/renovating and wrestling with
local zoning requirements.

Free-standing buildings are the choice of many salon owners because of their
high visibility in the community. Buying or leasing such a facility can be a
good choice because you’ll have more latitude when it comes to renovating and
decorating. You control the fixed costs like overhead, utilities, and (within
reason) the terms of the mortgage. You also don’t have to pay common-area
charges, like for snow removal, advertising costs, and security that are
incurred when you’re in a strip mall. Finally, you’ll have the tax advantages
of owning the building. Leasing a free-standing building gives you some of the
same advantages as buying, although you’ll have a landlord to deal with.

If you don’t want the responsibility of a free-standing building, consider
leasing space in a shopping center or a strip mall. These are choice locations
because of the exposure they offer, and leasing agreements usually have
provisions that limit the number of similar businesses in the same mall.

One common complaint from strip mall tenants is that hefty marketing and
maintenance fees are built into the leases. So inquire about them carefully
before you sign on the dotted line.

Storefront properties are also popular, particularly in communities with
historical or renovated downtown areas. Like a strip mall, these facilities
are part of a string of stores with common walls on either side. The
difference is that strip malls can spring up anywhere, including in
residential areas, while storefront properties generally are part of a
business district that stretches for blocks or even miles. If you can find a
storefront property to lease in a bustling downtown area, grab it immediately,
especially if it’s in a resort town with year-round activities.

There’s one other type of property that deserves serious consideration -- a
facility that once served as a hair salon. The good news is, a lot of the
infrastructure you’ll need may already be onsite and available for purchase
with the building. The bad news is, there might be a good reason why the salon
closed, like there’s too much competition in the area or the location is
crummy. If you’re seriously interested in taking over a now-defunct shop, find
out why the shop is on the selling block.Also consider remodeling costs vs.
the expense of starting with a blank slate in a different facility.

All this talk about finding a building to buy or lease is fine, but unless the
space is the right size, it won’t be a good fit for you. Salons usually range
from 1,200 to 2,000 square feet, although some are considerably smaller (fewer
than 1,000 square feet). If you’re planning to offer spa services, you’ll need
even more room.

You’ll need four separate areas in your hair salon: reception and retail,
shampoo, cutting/service, and storage. The largest of these should be your
salon services area, which should take up about 50 percent of the space. About
20 percent should be allotted to retail/reception, which should have enough
room for one or two stools for employees, as well as seating for five to 10
clients. Space permitting, a coffee table where you can display hairstyling
books and magazines is a nice touch. Ten percent should go to the shampoo
area, and the remaining 20 percent to storage, an employee break room and a
restroom.
