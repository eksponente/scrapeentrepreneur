How Does Your Business Rate?

Your credit score is the number on your credit report that helps lenders or
others predict how likely you are to pay any credit accounts on time. When we
talk about a "credit score," we mean your FICO score, which was developed by
the Fair Isaac Corporation.  
  
According to FICO, business scores above 750 are very good and a sign of good
financial health. A business credit score below 750 can indicate a higher
risk, which could lead to you being denied credit or a higher interest rate
and lower credit limit if you are approved.  
  
So what makes a credit score go down, and how does this affect my business
credit?  
  
Many people don't realize that whenever someone checks their credit, their
credit score goes down. This goes for your personal credit score and your
business credit score. There are some signs you can look for to see if your
credit score is tanking:

  1. If you are looking for a job, potential employers may do a credit check on you. This will cause your score to go down.
  2. If you are applying for credit for your business and your credit is checked, your score will go down each time your credit is checked.
  3. If you apply for credit anywhere--whether it's in person, online or through the mail--and your credit is checked, your score will go down regardless of whether you are approved or denied.  


  4. When you look for a rental space for your business, a landlord will most likely check your credit, lowering your score.
  5. If you or your business has ever had an account placed with a collection agency, the original creditor or the agency can check your credit occasionally in order to continue to try and collect from you. Each time they do this, your score goes down.

Another thing to be aware of is that your score may help determine how big a
deposit you may be required to have on a credit account--such as telephone,
electricity or fuel services--if you cannot get approved.  
  
Lenders, which can be anyone from whom you want to obtain credit, look at a
score when deciding if they should charge you interest or give you a credit
limit, and how much that should be. Having a higher score helps you to obtain
lower interest and a higher credit limit.

Having a good credit score for your business can help you save money, which is
something we all need to do in this economy. Each credit agency has its own
score for your business because each agency has different things reported to
them--some creditors look at all three agencies, while others look at just
one.  
  
You can easily improve your business's score by improving how you handle your
business credit. To do this it may be helpful to you to know the five parts of
your FICO credit score:

  1. 35 percent of your FICO score is based on your payment history
  2. 30 percent is based on how much you already owe others
  3. 15 percent is based on the length of your credit history
  4. 10 percent is based on new credit issued to you
  5. 10 percent is based on other factors such as what types of credit are listed on your credit report.

At some point, almost every business owner needs some type of credit. Try to
avoid using your personal credit history or personal guarantees and work on
building a good business credit profile now, before you really need it.
