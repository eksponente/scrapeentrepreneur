Prove Your Worth

While the wealth of the stock market exploded during the 1990s, the wealth of
entrepreneurs fizzled. As the decade dawned, small firms held just over 59
percent of the $5.7 trillion in total value of U.S. businesses, according to a
study by the SBA. By 2000, that share had fallen to 42 percent as soaring
stock valuations more than doubled big public valuations during the decade.

A lot has changed since then, and one of the changes is a switch in the
relative performance of small and big companies. The $11 trillion in big-
company value seen in 2000 had slumped 25 percent to $8.3 trillion by the
middle of 2002, the latest period for which figures are available. Meanwhile,
small-company value had fallen just 4 percent, to $4.1 trillion. What
happened? "Big companies have been hurt by the stock market. Most small
companies are not public. That's why the small-business share rose the last
couple of years," says Kathryn Kobe, chief economist at [Joel Popkin and
Co.](http://www.jpcecon.com), the Washington, DC, research firm that conducted
the SBA study.

If you're thinking this means investing in your own company is smarter than
investing in the stock market, you're right. Not only have small-company
values held up better than the stock market, but right now, formerly scarce
and costly items such as labor, facilities and equipment are plentiful and
cheap. As a result, entrepreneurs like Dave Ratner, owner of Dave's Soda & Pet
City, a pet-supply retailer in Agawam, Massachusetts, are finding that
investing in their companies has the allure once restricted to Internet IPOs.
Says Ratner, 51, "Now's the time [entrepreneurs] can really build value in the
company."

After more than a decade in which other forms of investment stole the
limelight, business owners are only beginning to wake up to the hidden value
in their own enterprises, adds Ray Manganelli, managing director at New York
City management consulting firm Strategic Decisions Group. In his book,
_[Solving the Corporate Value Enigma_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/de
tail/-/0814406920/qid=1074728155/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4029717-0752621?v=glanc
e&s=books) (Amacom), Manganelli says the average business creates only 60
percent of the value it is capable of creating.

Is that all bad? Not necessarily. That means entrepreneurs may be able to
increase the value of their companies by 40 percent simply by paying more
attention to it. "It's a tremendous prize," Manganelli says. "And that prize
can be the difference between profit and loss, between surviving and folding."

**Why Build Wealth?**  
Dean Dinas, senior economist and director of the Center for Economic and
Industry Research for the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts
(NACVA), a trade group for valuation professionals, estimates only about 5
percent of small businesses have had a formal valuation done by a qualified
professional. One reason is entrepreneurs are too busy running their companies
to be concerned about the value of those companies. Also, some don't think
they need to build or measure the value of their companies unless they plan to
sell.

There are, however, dozens of reasons to know and increase your company's
value, none of which have anything to do with selling it. Before you set up a
buy-and-sell agreement with a partner, decide how much life insurance to buy
as part of an estate plan, create an employee stock ownership plan, or apply
for an SBA loan, you must have a documented value for your business, Dinas
says.

Many entrepreneurs rely on balance sheets, income statements or a gut feeling
to estimate their companies' true value. But balance sheets and other
financial statements used in the daily operation of a business are only the
beginning when it comes to valuing a business. Intangibles such as customer
relationships and human resources don't show up on balance sheets but are
essential to accurate valuations.
