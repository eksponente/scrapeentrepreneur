It's a Win-Win

In 1994, one of Doug Brendle's customers, an R&D firm for the screen-printing
industry, approached him about engineering new technology to streamline the
screen-printing process. Brendle was the ideal candidate to get the job done:
An engineer and physicist by trade, he had also worked as a consultant for the
screen-printing and manufacturing industries. Though he had the necessary
technical expertise, he didn't have the $300,000 needed to fund a project of
that magnitude.

"Not only was it a funding issue, it was a time issue, too," recalls Brendle,
founder and CEO of [HardKore Inc.](http://www.hkgear.com/) in Cheyenne,
Wyoming. "It had to be done by a certain time, and it would have been
impossible for a company of our size to acquire that kind of funding that
fast, especially when we were already leveraged with other jobs."

But because his $1 million-plus firm was uniquely qualified for the
opportunity, his customer provided the necessary funding to carry the project
to completion. Brendle repaid the loan within six months by selling the newly
manufactured equipment to the customer at a discounted rate. The customer-
financed deal was not only financially lucrative, but it also took Brendle's
company, which manufactures a line of fitness equipment, down a new product
path. Says Brendle, "Without it, we wouldn't be building our own [screen-
printing] product line."

#### Filling the Financing Void

While Brendle's client was willing to meet him halfway because of his unique
manufacturing capabilities, there are a host of other reasons a customer would
support this type of financing arrangement. Perhaps the business needing the
loan is the exclusive supplier of a product or service in demand by a
customer's competitors. Or maybe the customer wants its supplier to step up
production to better serve its own needs. In either case, the customer may
have a strong incentive to lend financial support.

"I've seen this when you have a large customer dealing with smaller suppliers
that usually are either producing a very unique product or a proprietary
product," says business consultant Deborah House, founder and CEO of [The
Adare Group](http://www.theadaregroup.com/) in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois.
"The customer needs to buy a widget. They don't want to make it and can't find
anybody else to make it, so they'll provide financing to outsource it."

Even fast-food giant McDonald's has been known to provide local bakeries with
financial support to manufacture its sandwich buns. "They will work with the
bakery and [provide funding] if a new plant has to be built or if equipment
needs to be bought," House explains. "And they do that in a number of
different ways. It can be through a loan, it can be through equity or a
thousand combinations thereof."

Borrower beware, however: Anytime you invite a customer into your inner
circle, you run the risk of revealing too much about your business, including
how you make a product and how much it costs to produce. Additionally, the
customer may want to dictate pricing terms in return for investing its own
capital.

"There's always a catch to it," says House. "The catch can be that they want
you to devote the plant solely to making the buns needed for McDonald's
restaurants in a certain region of the country. The thing that comes along
with this is that McDonald's will usually tell you how much they'll pay for
the buns."

#### Another Cook in the Kitchen

This type of capital often comes with other strings attached. For instance,
it's not uncommon for the customer to require the borrower to turn over
certain operational functions in return for putting up the funds. "Often, the
business is out looking for money to begin with because there are some missing
elements," explains David Young, business development specialist for the
[Washington State University Small Business Development
Center](http://www.wsbdc.org) in Seattle. "Those may be management or
accounting issues. When the customer sees some merit in putting funding in,
those are the [deals where] you most often see the operating criteria go in
with [the funding]. They may even take some functions away from the company
seeking the funding. They may decide to do the accounting, or they may decide
to do the backroom management of suppliers if they see some real weaknesses."

House concurs: "The business owner is getting capital, but they're probably
getting an operational partner and an executive partner as well."

Brendle discovered this when his customer/lender asked for so many project
updates that it interfered with productivity. "We had no idea that we needed
to lay down some rules, but you can't have someone micromanaging you," he
says. "If you're going to get funding, it's got to be funding with the
understanding that you can get your job done. That's the biggest thing." In
later deals, Brendle worked out an arrangement with the customer to provide
biweekly updates. "We had a system so nobody was calling and asking for
anything, but they were kept up-to-date as to where [the project] was going
and whether it was on schedule or behind," he says.

He was also careful not to part with anything he wasn't willing to give up.
Case in point: his client wanted exclusive rights to the screen-printing
equipment he manufactured on its behalf, even though it was Brendle's own
patented design. Says Brendle, "When they found out how much it would cost to
buy exclusivity, they backed off."

#### Risky Business

As Brendle can attest, customer financing isn't a relationship to take
lightly. In addition to arguments over ownership rights, there are sometimes
long-term funding ramifications for being so closely connected to a single
client. "Once you get tied to a particular customer and they're providing over
50 percent or even 20 percent of your total revenue, then you may not be as
attractive to a bank because you're a higher risk if that customer goes away,"
House stresses. "And you may not be able to get venture funding because now
you have a partner in your business."

As a result of these potential drawbacks, it's imperative that you evaluate
prospective funding partners carefully. "Do you like them? Do you trust them?
It's definitely worth spending some money on professional business and legal
advice," House advises. "Using other people's money is always a really good
thing to [help you] grow as long as you look at what the risks and rewards
are. Realize what you're giving away and what you're getting in return. And
always know how you can get divorced before you get married--the exit strategy
is almost more important than the contract signing."
