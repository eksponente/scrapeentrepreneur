5 Things You Must Do to Successfully Launch a Business

The effort required to launch a new venture can seem daunting. Of course,
specifics vary based on the type of business you're establishing;
manufacturers face unique challenges, as do retailers and consulting firms.
But once you have your concept and your finances in line, there are some
basics that are universal.

We talked with business owners, consultants and professors to boil down the
bare necessities of getting a startup off the ground into a handful of
manageable steps. Apply these fundamentals to your own industry, and you'll be
ready to tackle the specifics of creating your successful business.

## 1\. Validate your idea.

Einas Ibrahim, founder of Talem Advisory, a New York City startup consultancy,
says the biggest mistake she sees new entrepreneurs make is starting to work
on a business idea before confirming that there is market demand. If your
startup aims to sell a widget the world has never seen, make sure the world,
in fact, needs your widget. Perhaps it doesn't exist yet because no one needs
it. If it is needed, then make sure the world is willing to pay for it.

"Don't work on the business until you've validated the idea," Ibrahim says.
"Make sure there's a market. Make sure it's what the customer wants. Sometimes
the entrepreneur's vision doesn't align properly with what customers want."

Market research proves especially critical for startups with big dreams. If
you're aiming to become a billion-dollar business, take steps to ensure that
the market can satisfy your aspirations.

"Entrepreneurs find this out after they start talking to investors," Ibrahim
says. "The idea might be sound, but it might be too small to become fundable
by a professional investor, or by angels or venture capitalists. If the whole
market is less than $500 million, it's not going to be worthwhile for a
venture capitalist to fund you."

## 2\. Shore up your plan and budget.

Even the best business plans go awry. Successful startups will expect the
unexpected--and have an answer ready for it.

"Have a plan for how the business will be run," says Leonard Green, founder
and chairman of The Green Group, a New Jersey-based accounting, consulting and
tax firm, and entrepreneurship professor at Babson College. "It's a form of
making decisions before you have to make decisions."

Those decisions should range from your startup's mission to its business
structure (LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corporation) and compensation policy.

When budgeting startup cash needs, assume your business will generate zero
revenue for the first year, Green says. "Many times when you have sales, you
don't have collections for a few months," he adds. "You still have to cover
rent, utilities, inventory, salaries and promotion."

## 3\. Build the right team.

Perhaps the most critical step in the evolution of your startup is assembling
a team that works well together and can deliver the goods. "Many good
entrepreneurs are by nature connectors of people, so they have strong
networks, which puts them at an immediate advantage," notes Mark Coopersmith,
a longtime tech entrepreneur and senior fellow at the University of
California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business.

Your teammates need to share your ideas about how the business should be run.
"The crucial element here is that entrepreneurship is a team sport," Cooper-
smith says. "Build the team early, and build it around shared values. Because
if you bring on employees and partners and you agree upon common values, you
can use those values to come to decisions."

Coopersmith invokes the late Peter Drucker, the management guru who 60 years
ago wrote that corporations have only two core functions: marketing and
innovation. In other words, businesses exist to build and sell product. "I
would ensure my team comprises those two skill sets," he says.

Additionally, you need a team that's pragmatic and able to work together when
times get tough. Sit down with critical team members and plan for all
contingencies. "What happens if your partner becomes disabled? Sick?
Divorced?" Green asks. "Or suddenly the business does poorly, and now we have
to go to a bank? You've got to decide those things beforehand, so that it's
not you or me, but it's us."

## 4\. Establish a support system.

The entrepreneur's journey can seem like a solitary quest. But before you
embark on such a voyage, you need to make sure your loved ones have your back.
In fact, it's essential to your emotional health--and to the health of your
company.

"I always say it takes a village to raise a startup," says Margaux Guerard,
co-founder and CMO of Memi, a firm touting wearable technology designed for
women. "As an entrepreneur, you just can't do this alone. You need the mental
and emotional support of your friends and family to help you weather the
storm."

Guerard left her job as director of marketing at Diane von Furstenberg to
start Memi with her business partner, Leslie Pierson, in 2012. Her first
entrepreneurial venture has been an around-the-clock whirlwind--exciting,
frustrating, rewarding and upsetting, sometimes all in the same day. She
relies on her loved ones to help keep her on track.

"I see myself as being the cheerleader for the company," Guerard says. "When
everyone is saying 'no,' I'm putting my pompoms on and saying 'yes, yes, yes'
at the top of my lungs. When I'm feeling frustrated and sad and beat up, some
days I need help doing that. Who do I count on? My family, my friends, my
husband."

## 5\. Respond to feedback and refine your model.

When Bayard Winthrop conceived his notion to manufacture an American-made
hoodie, he outfitted hundreds of potential customers in prototypes and asked
them what they thought. How did the fabric feel? Was it too rough? Too soft?
Too clingy?

Without soliciting such detailed feedback from your most likely customers,
says Winthrop, founder and president of San Francisco-based American Giant,
you'll never know if your idea is a good one. "We did everything from putting
imagery up on the website to making 100 sweatshirts and getting them into
people's hands," he says.

American Giant, which launched in 2012, has been credited with rethinking
every inch of the ubiquitous hoodie. Before the company launched, Winthrop
asked customers their thoughts about all aspects of the garment: the cuffs,
the fit, the hood, even the zipper. The fabric alone took six months to fine-
tune.

"In our particular, narrow world of sweatshirts, getting that right is like
cooking a great meal," Winthrop says. "That required getting it onto backs and
asking people what they would pay for it."

Feedback led physician Mitesh Patel, co-founder of Docphin, to tweak his
technology. He designed his platform to help healthcare professionals get fast
access to research articles published in medical journals. The emphasis was on
fast.

But the site's initial registration process proved cumbersome, leading many
frustrated users to log off. Docphin scaled back, asked fewer questions of
first-time users and reduced the average sign-up time to two minutes. Users
returned in droves. Today Docphin serves 500 hospitals nationwide.

"For us," Patel says, "it was all about finding out what is the value of the
end user, and how can you get them to achieve that value as quickly as
possible. What we found was the real value was speed."

For startup entrepreneurs, the need to constantly tinker with the business
never ends. "You have always got to be thinking about how you can tweak
whatever you have to make it even better," says David Rush, co-founder and CEO
of Earshot, a Chicago-based company that helps businesses acquire new
customers through social media. Rush's initial venture was an app called
Evzdrop that allowed strangers in the same location to communicate with one
another. Customers told Rush they wanted to be able to access more widely used
social networks. Seeing a better business opportunity, he pivoted, and in
October 2013, Evzdrop became Earshot.

"You have to be acutely aware of what the data are telling you and what you
are able to learn about either your competitive landscape or the market you're
trying to serve or the problems you're trying to solve," Rush says. "It's a
continuous product. You're never satisfied."
