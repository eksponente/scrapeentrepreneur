Tax Tips for Online Entrepreneurs

When tax time rolls around, you can hear the collective groan of all the
businesspeople who have to start sorting their financial records and finding
out just how much they're going to have pay the government this year. Chances
are that even though you operate an online business, you're feeling pretty
much the same way as the dreaded tax season approaches. However, there are
some facts about your taxes that might help ease your woes.

For example, do you operate your business from your home? The majority of
online entrepreneurs do, and that entitles them to take some significant tax
deductions if you meet certain IRS conditions. For one, your home office must
be used "exclusively" and "regularly" for business use. That means the primary
purpose of that space is for business, such as contacting clients or managing
your books. It also means that the space is not used for family or personal
activities, unless you want to start dividing up that time by saying 75
percent of the time the home office is used for business and 25 percent of the
time it's used for playing games or doing homework.

The second IRS stipulation is fairly easy for most online business owners to
meet: Your home office must be your "principal place of business."
Essentially, that phrase just means that the business activities you conduct
in your home office can't be conducted anywhere else, such as in a rented
office space.

If you meet both of those requirements, then you can deduct many of the costs
associated with your home, including property taxes, utility bills, insurance
costs, mortgage or rent payments, even the cost maintaining your property. Of
course, if your mortgage payment is $800 per month, you can't deduct that
entire amount if you only use a small portion of your home for business. You
need to determine what percentage of your home is used as a home office, then
you'll use that figure to calculate the deductions you can take. For example,
if your home office represents 10 percent of your home's square footage, and
your mortgage payment is $800 per month, then you could deduct $80 every
month, which would be $960 for the year. The same applies to all the other
expenses related to your home.

You do need to be aware of one thing when calculating these deductions: You
can't use them to demonstrate a net loss during that tax year. For example, if
your online business generated $50,000 in revenue in 2004, but you could claim
$60,000 worth of home business deductions that year, then you can't claim a
net loss of $10,000. Instead, you could only report zero net gain. However,
you can carry that remaining $10,000 onto next year's taxes to help you reduce
your tax burden.

To calculate your home office deductions, you'll need to complete Form 8829
and report that total amount on Schedule C. All of these forms are available
online at the [IRS's website](http://www.irs.gov/) . Remember that you can
also deduct other business expenses, such as the cost of owning your domain
name, paying your web-hosting company, designing your website and accessing
the internet. (These fees will have to be pro-rated, however, if your family
or you use the internet for non-business-related activities.)

Another tax-related issue that might be bothering you is what to do with any
and all of the people who did work for your online business, such as the web-
design company that helped you establish a presence on the internet, the
copywriters who created press releases and marketing letters to help you gain
new business and publicity, and the person who answers your customer calls or
responds to customer e-mails. By law, you have to report how much you paid
these individuals during the tax year, but you also have to know how to report
that information and which forms to send to those individuals.

You have two choices: They could be independent contractors or employees.
There is a big difference between them. With independent contractors, you
aren't responsible for paying Social Security, Medicare or unemployment taxes,
while with an employee you have to cover all those expenses. For that reason,
most online business owners choose to work with independent contractors.

While the IRS has established a set of 20 questions that can help you
determine whether an individual doing work for you is an employee or an
independent contractor, one of the easiest ways to make that determination is
to ask yourself one question: Do I control "what will be done and how it will
be done"? If you answered yes, then the individual is an employee, and you
will need to send him a W-2 regardless of how long he worked for you and how
much money he earned.

If you answered no, then the individual is classified as an independent
contractor by the IRS. With an independent contractor, you still can control
"what will be done," but you can't control "how it will be done." You would
send them a Form-1099 if they did more than $600 worth of work for you during
the year.

Because classifying the individuals who do work for your online business is
important (the IRS could force you to pay the back taxes and even a penalty if
you misclassify an employee), you should always have them sign a contract
stating that they are doing work for you as an independent contractor. That
way, both parties know what their specific relationship is going to be from
the beginning, and you don't have to sort everything out during tax time.
