Understanding Convertible Loans

> Many people have recently inquired about the concept of convertible
[loans](http://www.entrepreneur.com/bestbanks). In fact, my own venture is
right now in the process of closing a second-stage [ "B" round
funding](/money/financing/financingcolumnistdavidnewton/article50026.html)
package that's comprised of both additional common stock (equity) as well as a
convertible line of credit.

The two main questions in this area are: 1) How do these convertible loans
actually work, and what are their features, and 2) What exactly are the long-
term effects on my business in terms of benefits and possible risks?

A convertible loan is first and foremost a loan--plain and simple. It involves
borrowed money that has to be paid back with interest. Typically, the
conversion feature gives the lender an option to convert all or a portion of
the outstanding principal of the loan into some form of an equity position in
the borrower's company. In its most basic form, the lender has reserved the
right to exchange his or her creditor position with the company to become an
owner in the company. The borrower is willing to provide the lender that
option in exchange for securing more favorable terms on the loan. For example,
the borrower could ask for any combination of concessions, such as: no closing
costs on the deal, no prepayment penalties, a lower interest rate and/or
"payment vacations" within the term of the loan. (These are often requested
for strategic times when the company anticipates significant fluctuations in
cash flow.)

The convertible loan allows the lender to swap a fixed dollar loan value for
an equity position in the borrower's company that could be worth (over time)
far more than the original loan value. Take the case of the $375,000
convertible loan at 7.5 percent interest (compounded monthly) for eight years.
The borrower pays $5,200 per month, and in 96 months the loan is paid in full.
The lender could have charged 9.25 percent plus $20,000 in upfront closing
fees on a traditional loan, but was willing to waive the fees and drop the
rate by 175 basis points. The borrower agreed that the lender could convert
any outstanding principal into common stock at a preset conversion price of,
say, $2.65 per share.

The lender gave up $20,000 on the front end plus more than $300 per month on
the regular payments (more than $32,000 over the life of the loan). These
concessions are the "price" of that convertible option "paid" to the borrower.
The company may be doing very well during the fourth year, when the
outstanding loan balance is $235,000. The lender has to decide: Is it more
valuable to receive $5,200 per month for another four years, or should I
convert this loan balance to 88,680 shares of common stock in the borrower's
company? Certainly, if the lender felt that those shares could be worth around
$5 or $6 per share within the next three to four years, that position would be
far more advantageous than remaining a creditor and receiving monthly loan
payments (perhaps $228,000 from the loan vs. more than half a million dollars
as a shareholder).

Because that decision is only up to the lender, the borrower should always
plan on making regular loan payments all the way until the maturity date. If
the lender wants to convert, the borrower is contractually obliged to make
common shares available at the conversion price in order to swap out the debt
balance for equity in the firm. The firm can benefit from an exercised
conversion in that a significant liability on the balance sheet is removed and
the owner's equity increases representing the new shareholder stake. This
improved financial position could help the borrower in securing other future
deals by increasing the company's net worth.

If the lender decides to convert, it is a one-way street. Once the loan
balance has been converted to equity, the lender cannot change his or her mind
if the stock does not perform as per expectations. On the other hand,
convertible loans can be a great win-win situation for the two parties. The
borrower gets funding with some pricing concessions, and a potential windfall
to owner's equity with a reduction in (or elimination of) debt at conversion.
The lender gets a possible windfall in appreciated value later on with lower-
risk fixed payments on the front end. Overall, convertible loans offer another
creative way to secure funding for entrepreneurs willing to

some potential ownership value in the future.
