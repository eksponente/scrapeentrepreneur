staff at Entrepreneur Press and writer Jacquelyn Lynn explain how you can get
started in the freight brokerage industry, from your first steps to hiring
employees, marketing your business and managing your finances. In this edited
excerpt, the authors share information from the trenches about how to survive
in the freight brokerage industry._

Nothing teaches as well as the voice of experience. So we asked established
freight brokers what has contributed most to their success and what they think
causes companies to fail. Here’s what they told us:

**Use Advertising and Marketing Techniques that Work**

Track your marketing efforts so you can concentrate on the techniques that
work and eliminate the ones that don’t.

Smyrna, Tennessee, freight broker Cathy Davis said small giveaway items, such
as pens, note pads, caps and T-shirts, work well. Company newsletters with
personal and industry information also get a good response. She said donations
to fundraising events may be helpful (depending on the event and the degree to
which it’s promoted), but the impact of website sponsorships is questionable.
She recommended developing a three-panel printed brochure that's easy to
include with letters, invoices and checks.

Chuck Andrews, an Indianapolis-based freight broker, builds name recognition
by placing periodic ads in association newsletters as well as in annual
association and industry directories.

**Prepare for the Future**

It’s understandable that if you're just getting started, that's your primary
focus, but you also need to think about the future. Develop a succession plan
that you review and revise annually. Know how leadership will be transferred
when it becomes necessary—either through voluntary or involuntary departures.

**Don’t Reinvent the Wheel**

Look around for good ideas and good products that people are already using
that you can incorporate into your operation. Everything you do doesn’t have
to be original; get ideas from other brokers, carriers, shippers and even
totally unrelated businesses.

Bloomingdale, Illinois, freight broker Ron Williamson learned this the hard
way when he hired someone to develop a proprietary computer system. “That was
a mistake because it wasn't a totally integrated system that would save us
time and make us more efficient,” he recalls. “Later on, we found a packaged
program that had all the bells and whistles we needed.”

**Get Rid of Carriers That Don’t Perform**

Every trucking company will have  an occasional service problem, but when the
service failures become chronic, drop the carrier from your roster. “You won’t
keep your customers very long if you’re having constant problems with your
carriers,” says Ron Williamson. Of course, he acknowledges that in the
beginning, you probably won’t know who all the good and bad carriers are.
While it’s one thing to be understanding and give a carrier a second chance,
you need to draw the line before the problems affect your own business.

**Maintain a Broad and Diverse Customer Base**

You need enough customers so that losing one—or even several—isn't
devastating. One of the biggest mistakes Davis ever made when she ran her
freight brokerage was allowing one customer to control too much of her
company’s revenue. When that customer pulled away with very little notice, she
was left scrambling to replace that business.

**Get in the Spotlight**

Because the freight industry is such a strongly relationship- and reputation-
based business, it helps to put yourself in the public eye in a positive way
as often as you can. Davis saw a favorable impact on her business from being
the recipient of awards and by getting bylined articles published in trade
publications.

**Be Open to Evolution**

Though a freight brokerage is extremely lucrative on its own, it’s also a
business that can lead to the development of other transportation-related
operations, from consulting to buying trucks and being a carrier. Cherry Hill,
New Jersey, freight broker Bill Tucker, for example, offers a wide range of
logistics services.

Andrews started as a broker, then created his own separate trucking company to
handle moves where the carriers he was using were short on equipment. Ron
Williamson also started as a broker and has since created two trucking
operations.

**Protect Your Reputation**

“Focus on building the highest-quality reputation you possibly can,” advises
Tucker. “When a shortcut presents itself but it’s a little on the shady side,
have the fortitude to pass it by, no matter how big the opportunity may seem.
There are so many people in this industry who need good, solid, honest,
reputable service—and long term, that’s where the big money is. You survive,
and you won’t have a lot of doors closing to you because some bad story got
out.”

Tucker compares the industry to a small village. “Everybody knows everybody
else’s business. It’s amazing how fast word travels. Nothing will put you out
of business or limit your success faster than the story of one bad transaction
or one nasty court loss because of bad practices getting out into the
marketplace. You’re going to have to sweat for a while, pull your belt in once
in a while, and [endure] some tough times. But do it the right way every time,
don’t take any shortcuts, provide high-quality service and maintain your
integrity, and you’ll always have customers willing to pay a fair price and
good carriers that want to work with you.”
