Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Steps Down From Square's Board of Directors

Howard Schultz has stepped down from the board of
[Square](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/square), to be replaced by former
Goldman Sachs exec David Viniar.

Schultz’s exit from the mobile-payment company comes as no shock, as the
Starbucks CEO took the position planning to stay for a year. Schultz joined
Square’s board [last August](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/31
/starbucks-square-idUSL3N0IL04H20131031), investing $25 million to use its
technology to process credit card payments in Starbucks stores.

“Jack (Dorsey) has assembled a strong and forward-thinking leadership team at
Square,” said Schultz in a [statement](https://squareup.com/news/releases/2013
/square-names-former-goldman-sachs-cfo-david-viniar-to-board-of-directors). “I
am proud of what our companies have accomplished together this past year and
I’m excited about the opportunities for Starbucks and Square to continue to
innovate.”
