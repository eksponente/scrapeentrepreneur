How About That 'B' Round?

When you launched your firm with equity capital, you sold shares to the
original investors at a set price, issued the common stock certificates, the
money transferred into the company account, and off you went spending the
funds on the items disclosed previously in your business plan. Life was good.
People were hired, equipment was purchased, leases were signed, contracts were
executed, and handshake agreements finally had cash to back them up.

Waiting for revenue to come in to your firm, at a level sufficient to cover
your regular monthly operating expenses, can be frustrating in the early
going. The bills are still there every week, but the sales dollars are still
inconsistent (or in the case of many new launches, _nonexistent_). You know
your venture is ready to turn the corner and close on a few solid revenue
deals, but you're not quite ready to dig too deeply into the company's line of
credit until there is a clear path to reliable cash flow coming into the firm.

Raising another round of equity capital is probably not all that exciting of a
project at this point, but it often turns out to be a necessary endeavor given
the open-ended nature of nailing down when regular sales will start to happen.
Your initial funding deal is your "A" round, often called the seed round or
the "launch capital." Too often, entrepreneurs believe there is some kind of
shame in asking for money in a subsequent round of funding, because they're
afraid that it appears they didn't do a very good job budgeting the initial
capital raised. But that's simply not the case.

Many things in running a business turn out to be more expensive than
originally planned for. Salaries and benefits are often higher than the
figures quoted when the budget was constructed. And sales don't always come
strolling into the company's "in-box" at the pace projected in the business
plan. Raising additional capital through a "B" round is a very normal process
in venture development. But there are _good_ ways to go about it, and
_awkward_ ways to try and make it happen.

Let's start with the favorable scenarios. Pitching your venture to investors
in a "B" round can be a very positive experience for the entrepreneur and the
capital providers. If you have a solid track record of benchmarks achieved;
personnel successfully recruited, hired and trained; partnerships put in
place; and customers in the sales pipeline, then the venture is right on track
with its targets. It simply might be that these haven't happened in the exact
same time frame originally envisioned.

If you have a tight paper trail summarizing your strategies employed, board
meetings, contracts in place, employees and projects completed and still in
process, investors will generally view that next round of funding as a
favorable time to get into the firm, because so many items that were once all
outstanding and pending are now finished and in place. The risk of investing
in a "B" can actually be viewed as lower than the "A" round, if the
entrepreneur does a great job of documenting the forward progress of the
organization.

But if the investors have little to go on in the way of tangible evidence that
you've done a great job in moving the venture forward, asking for another
round of cash could easily be interpreted as giving money to someone who
doesn't have a solid plan for success. When you come asking for equity capital
without a clear demonstration that you're competent to lead this enterprise,
investors' confidence in you is greatly diminished. But when you come asking
for a second round (or later a third round, "C") and investors see that you're
well on your way to making this business a solid reality in the market, and
it's just a matter of timing on some very promising deals, they will be much
more receptive to your pitch.

And remember, your "A" round investors probably have a preemptive right in
their stock agreement to maintain their relative percentage equity stake in
the firm when the company issues subsequent shares, so you'll need to approach
them first to see if they have interest in backing you with some more cash. If
you have your company's house in order, "A" round investors often have a
strong interest in being capital providers for the following rounds, and why
not--they know you and your work. And be aware that some of them may want to
"pass" on their preemptive right (for various reasons not involving you), and
that's OK. But be sure they don't opt out of the next round because of their
lack of confidence in your ability to run a tight ship.
