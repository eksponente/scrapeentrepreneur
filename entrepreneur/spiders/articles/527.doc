Cut Your Financing Costs

Like any business owner, Jeff Samuelson never has cash flow far from his
thoughts. "We want to be more liquid so we can be nimble in making decisions
and not [be] locked into raising [money] to get something done, like funding a
new product line or making other moves in the business," says the owner of
Samuelson True Value Hardware and Lumber in Craig, Colorado.

Until recently, though, that was difficult because the business's cash flow
was being squeezed by a hodgepodge of short-term, variable-rate loans--12 in
all. Samuelson knew that consolidating those credit products, which ranged
from equipment leases to commercial real estate loans, would help reduce
financing costs. And with interest rates rising, the time had come to make the
switch to fixed-rate financing. "We knew that if we didn't lock in the
adjustable-rate loans, the interest rates would continue [to increase],"
recalls Samuelson, 40, who owns and operates the $8.5 million business with
his brother, Mark. "We knew we were going to save substantially [with fixed-
rate loans]."

To that end, the Samuelson brothers recently consolidated the company's
outstanding debt into a $1.4 million loan that has a fixed rate and a longer
amortization schedule. "We improved the average rate we were at by
consolidating into one loan," Jeff says. "We also improved the rate because of
the [interest-rate] climate we're in now, whereas before, we had loans that we
had [obtained] over the years at different times [and at higher interest
rates]. I thought this was a good time to lock the rates before they continued
to increase."

By refinancing, the company saw its interest rate decrease to 6.78 percent
from an average rate of 7.8 percent, and it is now realizing a monthly cash-
flow savings of $8,000. "When you're talking about loan amounts [of this
size]," says Jeff, "a point or two can make a big difference."

In for the Long Haul  
Interest rates have risen steadily since June 2004, when the Federal Reserve
Board raised short-term interest rates for the first time in four years. This
has led to a gradual but significant increase in the prime rate, which sets
interest rates for floating-rate loans. "When interest rates are falling, a
variable-rate loan is the way to go," says John Milbauer, president and CEO of
Patriot Bank Minnesota in Lino Lakes, Minnesota. "But in a time of rising
interest rates--where we are right now--anyone who has a variable-rate loan
should be trying to fix the rate to make sure they have a handle on what their
interest costs are going to be over the next several years."

In reality, though, some types of variable-rate credit cannot be converted
into long-term, fixed-rate financing. That's because certain assets are simply
too short-term in nature. Cases in point: inventory and accounts receivable.
"Banks aren't too keen on giving you a long-term loan on an asset that's going
to potentially disappear during the term of the loan," says Scott Page,
executive vice president of [Vectra Bank
Colorado](http://www.vectrabank.com/)in Denver. "[A lender] wouldn't do a
revolving line of credit to support inventory and receivables as a three-year
loan because those receivables and inventory turn over so quickly."
