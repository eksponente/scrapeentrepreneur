PR Trends: A Press Release for Social Media

In the past few months, there's been a buzz swirling in the PR industry about
proposed changes to the format of the news release. The premise for the
changes is that while the current format provides readers with the basic
information regarding a company's news, it doesn't fully leverage the latest
wave of [social

technologies.

Commonly referred to as Web 2.0, the newest breed of internet-based services
allows people to collaborate and share information online, using tools such as
blogs, tags and user-generated content. Forward-thinkers in the PR community
are identifying opportunities to leverage such technologies to enhance the
exchange of information and spread your company's messages to even more
diverse audiences, while continuing to use the proven systems and techniques,
like newswire distribution and media targeting, that have been successful over
the past 50 years.

The format of the [new social media
news](http://www.entrepreneur.com/marketing/socialmedia/index.html) release
steps well away from the traditional, text-focused news release. It's designed
so that anyone accessing it--whether a journalist, a potential customer or a
curious onlooker--can quickly find and interact with its content.

The social media template is designed to contain these items:

  * A brief description of the news announcement
  * Quotes from the CEO or other execs, customers and analysts, if applicable
  * Photo/video attachments, or links to web pages that host these items
  * Links inside the release copy to background information, and relevant links to other news stories or reference sources
  * Digital tags (used to link to web tools such as Del.icio.us and Digg)
  * RSS Feed links
  * Links to podcasts and MP3 files, graphics and video

The social media release is especially beneficial to reporters and bloggers
because information is presented in a style that enables them to select the
type and level of information they desire--from detailed background
information on the company and quotes from senior executives to graphics and
photos.

For the general public, the social media release promotes greater online
accessibility through search engine optimization and linking from interactive
websites such as Del.icio.us and Digg. The template itself also allows users
the opportunity to provide feedback to the release's authors.

Can You Really Use It?  
So how practical is the social media news release? For entrepreneurs, the
question boils down to: Will my company benefit from the increased
functionality?

So far, the social media release has been used primarily by those in the tech
industry, which makes sense, since reporters, bloggers and customers in the
tech space are familiar with all the release's bells and whistles. If you have
a cutting-edge company, using the new release could even be viewed as a
benefit in itself--showcasing your business as a trendsetter in your field.
Other sectors that may benefit include the entertainment industry, companies
that appeal to youth culture or businesses that market highly visual products.

If your company falls outside these arenas, the social media release is still
something to look into. The written portion of the release, for instance, is
more a presentation of facts than an exercise in prose. You may find this
format a bit easier and less time consuming, especially with the aid of
automated services that help you put your release together, like [PRX
Builder](http://www.prxbuilder.com/). Further, if you rely on internet buzz
for driving business, you'll benefit from the inclusion of links, digital tags
and search engine optimization.

Ultimately, however, you'll have to decide if including such elements will
produce the desired results. The objective, as always, is to facilitate the
exchange of information and do so in a manner that'll attract attention to
your products or services.

Looking Ahead  
While the social media release has its advantages, the existing news release
format has been in use for more than 50 years and is unlikely to be superseded
quickly. However, the past several years have witnessed an increased use of
multimedia and interactive content in news releases. The top newswires, for
their part, anticipated this trend and are fully equipped to distribute such
material.

The future will see continued use of Web 2.0 tools and, over time, will cause
the release format to evolve. The best PR tactic for you is to be aware of
what's available and not be too cautious to try different techniques and
formats.

The key--and this remains the most important factor in getting visibility for
your news--is the quality of the content in your release, regardless of the
format. Writing a strong release with newsworthy information should always be
foremost in your mind. Finding the best format for your content should follow.
