Relief Valve?

Last fall, Kevan Casey, CEO of [eLinear](http://www.elinear.com/), had two
specific near-term goals for his Houston-based technology solutions company:
1) to get listed on the American Stock Exchange, and 2) to expand, beginning
with a new facility in Dallas. "We wanted to get off the [OTC] Bulletin Board
as soon as possible so we could get in front of large institutional investors
and start moving up the chain," says Casey, 32. One requirement for listing on
the Amex is a minimum of $4 million in shareholder equity, of which eLinear
had just $2.6 million.

With only $13.6 million in revenue for 2003, the company was too small for a
secondary offering. So eLinear's management team opted instead to do a Private
Investment in Public Equity (PIPE). PIPEs allow public companies to do a
limited distribution of securities-in common stock or convertible debt-to
accredited or institutional investors, quickly and quietly. "It's like a
hybrid of private and public capital," says Steven Dresner, co-author of
_[PIPEs: A Guide to Private Investments in Public Equity](http://www.amazon.co
m/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1576601404/entrepreneurcom)_ and publisher of _The
PIPEs Report_. It is public equity, but "it's much like the traditional
private equity market in that you have a select group of seasoned investors
who can look at deals and make very quick decisions," says Dresner.

Efficiency is one of the PIPE's draws. PIPEs can be executed in weeks, where a
secondary offering can take months. But the tight time frame allows for only
limited due-diligence investigation of potential shareowners. And business
owners often have to make a tough choice: either discount the stock-sometimes
by as much as 70 percent-or offer registration rights that allow investors to
sell sooner.

By closing three PIPE deals that raised more than $6 million, eLinear did
both. The first, completed last December, raised $1 million from about 80
individual investors who received common stock at a deep discount but must
hold the shares for at least a year. The second and third rounds, in January
and February, brought in $5 million from mostly institutional investors-
including hedge funds, which have been notorious shorters of stock in PIPE
deals and which have recently come under the SEC microscope for illegal
activity.

And eLinear's stock initially suffered from short selling, which came as a bit
of a shock to Casey. "I was under the impression that their intentions were to
grow with the company," he says of the round two and three investors.

Still, Casey says he wouldn't trade the compressed schedule. The capital
infusion allowed the company to list on the Amex, open a new facility in
Dallas and put away enough cash for several years. At the moment, the company
is planning some large acquisitions, which will further enlarge its footprint,
and is looking at a secondary offering 12 months out.

Going forward, however, Casey says he will turn a more skeptical eye on the
motivations of potential investors. "I would try to get to know them better,
have more one-on-one communication about where the company's going," he says.

That kind of investigation is absolutely critical to a successful PIPE, notes
Harlan Kleiman, senior managing director with New York City-based investment
bank [C.E. Unterberg, Towbin](http://www.unterberg.com/) and author of
_[PIPES: The CEO's Guide to Successful Private Investments in Public Equities]
(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0972662308/entrepreneurcom)_.
"Money always has a face behind it," he says. "You must know the profile of
the person who is buying that significant amount of your stock-or your company
can get hurt."

But the PIPE itself is a neutral mechanism, Kleiman adds. It's only as good as
those doing the deal. It helps that more big investment banks have been
getting in on PIPE action, collectively raising $447 million in banking fees
through PIPEs in 2003, an 80 percent increase over the prior year, according
to Sagient Research Systems, a San Diego firm that tracks PIPE deals. And with
$7 billion raised for companies in the first half of 2004-compared with $12
billion annually for 2002 and 2003-the PIPE market isn't slowing down.

Once seen as the scourge of capital raising, PIPEs are not just for troubled
companies anymore, says Colin Blaydon, director of the Center for Private
Equity and Entrepreneurship at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business.
"It's been done enough times by strong, viable enterprises that it can be
justified as a sensible alternative approach to financing."
