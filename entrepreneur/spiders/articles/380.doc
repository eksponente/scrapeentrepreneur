Get People to Pay You Quickly

To get your invoices paid in a more timely fashion, you must avoid thinking
rationally and logically, and instead think emotionally. (That sounds
backwards from what you usually hear, doesn't it?) People often do things that
don't make sense and aren't necessarily reasonable, and how they pay invoices
falls into that camp. Among the several factors that affect how your invoices
will get paid are the amount of money involved, the financial health of the
customer, the format of your invoice and your relationship with the customer.

It pays to work to improve your relationships with your customers--people pay
more quickly if they know and like you. And, in general, you want to try to
only take on customers who you know have the ability to pay. You are probably
already working on those factors, but you may not have given much thought to
an equally important factor: the format of your invoices. You probably just
send whatever your accounting software spits out. Be careful about this,
because the easier you can make this process for your customer, the more
quickly you'll get paid.

I run a home-building business, and I've noticed a few things about how I tend
to pay our invoices: If the amount is small, that invoice will tend to be paid
more quickly. For example, our biggest expense in a house is lumber. The
invoices from the lumber company are all sizes, from just a few dollars to up
to $20,000 or so, depending on what they bring to the job site and when.
Sometimes I won't have enough money to pay for everything at once, so I'll
often pay many of the smaller invoices first and leave the big one to the end.
That may not be logical, but I do it.

One of the most crucial factors in whether you're paid on time is whether your
invoice is clear and easy to understand. There are a few vendors who send me
invoices that are hard to read, don't have a consistent format, don't have the
job number on them, have unclear terms and so on. The harder an invoice is to
understand, the longer I procrastinate on it. If I pick up an invoice and see
that I am going to have to call and get job numbers or try to figure out what
it is actually for, I'll have a tendency to put it down and pick up another
one that is clear and can be entered into the system easily. Before you say
that this isn't reasonable or isn't the way it ought to be, you are right!
Unfortunately, however, it's just the way it is. You can't change that, but
you can work it to your advantage.

It is also important to make your terms clear and easy to understand. Use your
terms as a way to encourage payment. Be very specific about the due date, and
state it clearly:

  * Don't put "Pay by the 10th"; put "Pay by July 10, 2005."
  * Don't put "2% 10, net 20"; put "Take $25 off if paid by July 10, 2005."

I once had an invoice for $110 that said in big red letters "take $20 off of
this invoice if you pay by March 3, 2005." Even though I could have waited
several more weeks to pay and could have paid other invoices that were due
sooner, the 20 bucks caused me to pay it right then.

There are many things that influence how quickly your invoices get paid. Work
all of them to maximize your payment rate and improve your payment times. Find
out if a customer likes a certain format or wants certain information on the
invoice. The more you make your invoices fit in to your customers' accounting
systems, the more quickly and regularly they'll be paid.
