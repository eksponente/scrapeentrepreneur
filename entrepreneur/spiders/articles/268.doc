Determining the Value of a Business for Sale

I'm often asked this question: "If I'm thinking about buying an existing
company, how do I counter the seller's 'official' asking price?" And this
business finance question also shows up from the seller's side of the deal as
well, when I'm asked: "If I'm trying to sell my firm, how do I effectively
counter the buyer's offer?" Looking at the big picture, these two questions
actually relate to the same fundamental concern.

First, let's take the position of the seller. It's fairly normal to expect
that the seller of a business is responsible for getting the process started
by listing an asking price for the business. The seller has all the insider
information about the company's cash flows, assets, employees, contracts,
legal affairs, financial structure, partnerships and other alliances. The
seller has the most complete perspective on the true numbers that comprise the
firm's valuation. In starting the process, the seller essentially says,
"Attention interested parties: We believe the firm is worth this much, and we
have provided solid, tangible evidence and rationale to support that figure."
The biggest concern of the seller's valuation deals with disclosure.

There are four ways to view this. The value seems well-documented, offers good
rationale and is presented with a solid disclosure to support that figure. The
second is the other extreme, that the value comes across as poorly documented,
with highly questionable and suspect underlying rationale, and is presented
with minimal (if any) disclosure to the prospective buyers. The other views
are less cut and dry for the buyer to approach. The value could be accompanied
by several documents and a well-honed story to support the premise for the
asking price, but when it comes to very specific, footnoted disclosure, the
seller does not give away the details necessary for the buyer to weigh the
pricing. The fourth way involves what appears to be a lot of disclosure, but
the methodology and rationale on using all this disclosure are inappropriately
applied and the valuation doesn't quite make sense.

The second position, that of the buyer, is similar to the seller's in that a
value must be determined and then held to, even in the face of the other party
disagreeing with that number. But while the seller has the insider information
on the true numbers and detailed descriptions of the company's operations, the
buyer is left to work with limited or speculative information only and must
rely almost exclusively on his or her own due diligence in making the offer
price to the seller. Many deals are assumed to begin with the buyer at a
distinct disadvantage because of the lack of symmetry in the amount and
credibility of the information available in assessing the value of the
company.

Finally, they both want to know how the negotiation process should proceed
given all the back-and-forth of asking prices and counter offers. The key here
is that the seller usually tries to drive the negotiation process based upon
the insider perspective brought to the table. For example, the seller can
always say, "I know this piece of information is such and such, because I've
been running the firm for the past several years, so regardless of what the
industry averages are, this is the correct measure for this particular area."
What usually happens is that the buyer must shore up the offering price by
assembling a large arsenal of public information on other similar firms in
that same market and industry. This data helps build a basic context for what
a typical business (like the one under negotiations) sells for.

While the buyer insists that the deal be based on industry averages or
"comparable" firms, the seller tries to sway that argument in favor of the
unique nature and content of this particular deal. In the end, the best and
truest value of a company is the one that both sides can agree to. So be
prepared for plenty of back-and-forth, and always ask for new disclosures at
each round. Every successive volley in the bid-ask process must open up new
information to support the latest proposed adjustment in the pricing of the
company.

If the back-and-forth can settle at a value where both parties feel
comfortable, some of the negative concessions of these details can be resolved
to some degree in the terms of executing that value for the deal. If the two
sides cannot narrow the bid-ask spread sufficiently to close a deal (and this
happens often), then it's best to walk away and move on to the next best
potential deal, rather than hang on and try to make something happen where
clearly there is no deal to be done.
