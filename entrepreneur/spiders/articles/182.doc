Who Are Your Best Customers?

In a typical business, 20 percent of the customers are unprofitable. Worse
yet, says marketing veteran [Gloria Berthold](mailto:gloriab@marketing-
outsource.com), founder and president of [Outsource Marketing
Associates](http://www.marketing-outsource.com/)in Elk Ridge, Maryland, they
cause 80 percent of your headaches.

If Berthold is right, you'd be wise to dump one of every five customers. (If
you have a retail business, however, think twice before acting on that
advice.) Berthold further posits that another 20 percent of customers account
for 80 percent of profits.

It goes without saying, then, that you need to determine who your profitable
customers are. You can probably guess their characteristics: He or she will
value your product or service, accept your pricing structure, provide you with
repeat business, discuss options before making a final decision, trust you to
perform as promised, refer you to others, and pay bills on time.

In contrast, unprofitable customers always take issue with your prices, demand
services you don't normally provide, are never happy with the services you do
provide, and demand additional services but refuse to pay for them. They
purchase less frequently, are not steady customers, and invariably are slow-
or no-pays. They're always difficult, they're costly in terms of time and
effort, and they often spread negative stories about your company. "They are
not necessarily bad customers--just a bad match for your particular company,"
says Berthold. "They may work well with one of your competitors."

Furthermore, warns Berthold, high-volume clients are not always desirable.
They can be unprofitable if they're too demanding; insist on special care,
services and prices; and call for an inordinate amount of your staff's time
and attention.

So, to determine your best clients, Berthold suggests you assemble a list of
your high-volume customers and, from that, identify the top 20 percent of
profitable customers. Then create a profile of your ideal customer based on
location, industry, revenues, number of employees, sales strategies, buying
approaches and even the role of the person you deal with (HR director,
president, purchasing manager, buyer). "You want to capture each company's
personality and method of doing business," she says.

Once you've compiled a profile of your most profitable customers, you can
target comparable prospects when seeking new clients. "Your best prospects
will look like your best clients," notes Berthold. Similarly, a profile of
unprofitable customers can save you from wasting marketing dollars on the
wrong prospects.
