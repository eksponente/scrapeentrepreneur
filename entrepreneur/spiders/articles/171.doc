There's Now a Crowdfunding Campaign for a Permanent Cat Café in NYC

Can't imagine anything better than curling up with a cup of tea and a feline
companion? You may want to pony up some cash to make New York City's first
permanent cat café a reality.

Little Lions is attempting to raise $65,000 to open the city's first "cat
sanctuary and tea house." The café aims not only to provide a place for humans
to play with cats, but also give shelter cats the opportunity to find new
adoptive owners.

"In this serene oasis, humans and cats will be able to bond and realize the
mutual benefits of each other's' company, while friends and fellow cat lovers
share a pot of tea and a truly special experience," the company wrote on its
[Tilt.com crowdfunding page](https://littlelionsnyc.tilt.com/support-little-
lions-nyc-s-first-cat-sanctuary-and-tea-house).

Little Lions hopes to open in spring 2015, if it can raise the necessary
funds.

Cat cafés have been a hit in Japan and parts of Europe, and are just starting
to catch on in the U.S. The [Cat Town Café](http://cattownoakland.org/cat-
town-cafe/) and [KitTea](http://www.kitteasf.com/#!about_us/c161y) are slated
to open in the Bay Area this year. Purina sponsored a [cat café pop
up](http://www.purinaone.com/cats/28-day-challenge/nyc-cat-cafe) in New York
City in April that resulted in lines of eager customers that stretched out the
café's door.

However, while the customer base is present, there are still no permanent cat
cafes currently open in the U.S. A recent [Kickstarter to open a cat café in
Los Angeles](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1122280343/cats-cafe-lets-
bring-a-purrfect-combination-to-la) only raised $9,553 – well short of the
$350,000 goal. Aside from funding, cat cafés are forced to deal with issues of
sanitation standards and animal safety. Opening a cat café is no piece of
cake. But, for the 52 backers who have already donated to Little Lions, it is
worth the effort.
