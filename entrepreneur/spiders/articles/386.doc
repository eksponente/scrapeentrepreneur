Alternate Financing Routes

When David Nadeau and his partner, Rick Edwards, went looking for financing
this time last year, they had several goals: to buy out their primary investor
and become co-owners of their Portsmouth, Rhode Island, manufacturing company,
[Renova Lighting Systems Inc.;](http://www.renova.com/) to get short-term
working capital for the company's operations; and to secure long-term
financing to upgrade outdated manufacturing equipment and grow the business.
In their search, they heard about Job Bank, a state partnership with Citizens
Bank that offered a low interest rate to businesses that agreed to add jobs,
but it didn't look like the program would be renewed for 2006. So, they
decided to go with a traditional loan at a higher rate and with more
restrictive terms.

"Literally a day before the closing, we got a call from the bank saying the
program was back on," says Nadeau, 42. "It was a really nice, last-minute
boost for us." The bank offered to swap the paperwork, so Nadeau and Edwards
got the Job Bank financing, which offered an interest rate of just under 5
percent on a five-year loan for $300,000. And they were not restricted in how
they used the money, a change from the traditional term loan. The hitch? The
pair had to agree to add seven jobs during the next three years. "That was
already built into our longer-term plan," Nadeau says. "It just might have
happened later."

Rhode Island is one of many states offering financing programs tied to job
growth. For example, through a partnership between PNC Bank and the New Jersey
Economic Development Authority, business owners can get loans for as little as
$100,000 and still get the five-year treasury rate, around 4.5 percent, says
Tom Nist, senior vice president and manager of the small-business segment at
PNC Bank. "So if you [are] a business in New Jersey or [are thinking] about
locating in this area and need to do real estate development, now you can
borrow at the treasury rate. That's a dramatic departure from borrowing at an
SBA kind of rate. And frankly, it turns a little quicker."

Not all state programs are known for their loan processing efficiency, but in
general, they can offer significant benefits to entrepreneurs seeking cash to
grow, including lower rates, flexible conditions and access to sizable sums.
Often, they enable banks to take on riskier loans for entrepreneurs who might
not otherwise qualify for traditional financing. "And some loans have a lower
down payment requirement," points out Donna Holmes, director of the Penn State
Small Business Development Center in University Park. "The bank may do 50
percent, the state program another 40 percent, and the borrower only has to
come up with 10 percent; with a straight bank loan, the bank might be looking
for 20 percent or 25 percent."

Through the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, which makes loans for
equipment and real estate primarily to businesses with a few years under their
belts, borrowers may ante up as little as 15 percent, and they can get loans
of up to $20 million and terms of up to 20 years. "[It] makes capital
available to businesses that can't readily get those funds," says Alice
Kotrlik, division director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and
International Trade in Denver.

Because state programs vary widely, with some designed to boost certain
industries and others to inspire the achievement of certain goals, you will
need to find a program that agrees with your business' specific objectives. If
you try forcing a business strategy to qualify for a loan, you could wind up
with a penalty and a much higher interest rate. Nadeau isn't concerned about
that, noting that his company, which projects sales of $10 million for 2007,
has already hired nearly half of the quota necessary to fulfill its
obligation. The cash infusion has allowed him and Edwards, 45, to purchase the
new equipment, and they already have a financing commitment for a real estate
purchase to move the business to a bigger location. Says Nadeau, "I expect
that we will be growing at a steady pace."
