Coming Up Short

For Idaho entrepreneur Leo A. Geis, running his commercial aerial photography
business is somewhat akin to working without a net. Inconsistent customer
demand, changing technology, and the need to rapidly expand into new
geographic markets all make for an unpredictable commercial existence. "There
is no cookbook for a company like this, so we're guessing a lot," says Geis,
46, whose [Idaho Airships Inc.](http://www.idahoairships.com/) also
specializes in forensic imaging for use in litigation. "Because of that, we
[need] buffers financially that you don't [need] in established or more
predictable markets."

One of those safeguards has been short-term financing. Not long after
launching the Boise company in 1997, Geis had to upgrade his photography
equipment to get better aerial images. To fund the unanticipated purchase, the
half-million-dollar company borrowed $80,000, most of which was financed for
just one year. The interest rate was about 4 percent higher than for a longer-
term arrangement, but the flexibility was well worth the cost, in Geis' view.
"We don't know what we're making next week or four weeks from now," he says.
"It allows us to make a minimum payment if necessary or to load the payment
without penalty."

Though the company could have used its own capital to fund the transaction,
Geis thought there were more productive ways to use the cash. "We used
financing instead of cash to remain prepared for a variety of competitive
potentials, such as media campaigns," he says. The ease with which he could
obtain short-term funds also allowed the company to capitalize quickly on
geographic expansion opportunities, which are imperative in his industry. "We
might have to make major decisions, like opening up a new market, in four
days," says Geis, who now operates nationally. "There is no way to go out and
acquire equity capital or long-term high-dollar financing."

#### Filling a Temporary Void

For a quick-moving company like Geis', a primary benefit of short-term
financing is its flexibility; with it, a business can adapt swiftly to
changing market conditions while conserving working capital. Short-term
financing can also serve as a lifeline, helping sustain a shaky business
operation until it gains commercial footing.

In reality, too little capital can quickly derail a developing company, yet
many entrepreneurs don't appreciate the important role that short-term
financing-usually a loan or line of credit of up to one year-plays in cash-
flow management. Indeed, an interim funding arrangement not only allows
businesses to take on bigger deals and increase sales, but also helps ensure
they won't run out of operating capital before securing more permanent
financing. Rapidly growing companies are often the most vulnerable to capital
shortages, despite their sometimes-spectacular sales records. "Often, the
businesses that are growing have a need for cash that's just as great as a
business in decline or in temporary trouble," stresses Houston accountant
[Calvin Martin](http://www.calvinmartin.com/). "Growth requires additional
accounts receivable, and they do not generate cash until they're collected. At
the same time, you're paying for rent, for labor, for all your expenses that
require cash."

Whether a business is growing at breakneck speed or developing at a more
controlled pace, winning the cash-flow battle requires vigilant monitoring of
sales activity, expenses and customer payment patterns. This allows owners to
pinpoint and deal with a cash-flow deficiency before it evolves into a full-
scale crisis. "If sales are declining, you need to find out why," Martin
advises. "You may need short-term financing to pump up those sales through
advertising and promotion."

#### Spend Wisely

Bear in mind that short-term financing isn't ideal for all kinds of capital
shortfalls. As a general rule, short-term debt should fund business activities
that will generate cash flow to repay the loan. Businesspeople need to
distinguish between a temporary investment in current assets and a permanent
investment, says consultant John Barrickman, president of [New Horizons
Financial Group](http://www.newhorizonsfinancial.com) in Roswell, Georgia.
"With a temporary investment, you finance the purchase of the asset with the
intent of liquidating the asset in the normal course of business." An example
is a retailer who builds up inventory in the fall in anticipation of the
holidays: "They'll sell the inventory during the Christmas season and pay the
loan back in January, and not have another need until the subsequent fall,"
Barrickman says.

On the other hand, a company that has to constantly replenish its inventory
may have difficulty managing short-term debt. "A lot of times, the lender will
finance it with a line of credit," he says. "But every time that line matures,
the borrower better be sure the lender is prepared to renew it or [convert the
debt to a term loan], because, if they don't, the borrower is going to have to
find another institution to loan them the money." Short-term financing is also
risky if a business suffers a temporary setback but its lender refuses to
extend the loan period. "It's a shame to see a company with positive sales
growth and positive earnings [lose] its ability to obtain supplies to build
their products or to deliver their services," says Rick Vycital, regional
director of the [Idaho Small Business Development
Center](http://www.idahosbdc.org) in Boise.

While entrepreneurs sometimes have only themselves to blame for cash-flow
difficulties, external market forces, such as labor shortages or oil prices,
can wreak havoc on even well-run companies. In Geis' case, soaring gas prices
generate uncertainty. "If gas goes to $3.50 a gallon, using an airplane is
going to go right down the tubes," he declares. But rather than sit back and
hope that rising fuel costs won't limit operations, he has used interim
financing to help fund the purchase of energy-efficient gear. "[Without short-
term financing], I'd be stuck with a particular business model for two or
three more years every time I did something," Geis adds. "And two or three
years is two generations right now in terms of business cycles in my
industry."

No Surprises

When short-term financing is necessary to "bridge a problem," an entrepreneur
should demonstrate that the funds aren't merely a temporary resolution to a
permanent predicament, says Rick Vycital, regional director of the Idaho Small
Business Development Center in Boise.

According to Vycital, financial backers are more likely to lend their support
when the business owner has genuinely sought solutions to a crisis. "Just to
keep borrowing and not change the source of the problem is not the type of
loan that a bank or investment company would be willing to, or should be asked
to, entertain," he says. "You'd better show how you're going to support the
loan with changes, improvements and increased profits."

The good news is that lenders and investors are often receptive to short-term
funding interventions because they have a vested interest in an entrepreneur's
success; in many instances, they have contributed more funding to the
developing business than the owner. What they expect in return is an open line
of communication. "Your job as the owner is to communicate the status of your
company," Vycital stresses. "Getting to the point where you have a calamity
and surprising them-why would you do that?"
