Before September 11, [Le Gourmet Gift Basket Inc.](http://www.legift.com) was
growing at a healthy clip. But in the months that followed the attacks, with
steep drops in the stock market and mounting layoffs, many of its would-be
customers began welshing on their contracts and bouncing checks. Five of them
went bankrupt in a 10-month period. "I've never seen anything like it," says
Cynthia McKay, 47, president and CEO of the Denver-based franchise.

McKay stood in line with the other creditors but was mostly unsuccessful in
her efforts to recoup her investments. Although there might be some indication
of a problem beforehand, she says, often "you don't know 'til you get that
little postcard [from bankruptcy court]."

Thanks to the continuing dismal economic climate, bankruptcy announcements
have been darkening the mailboxes of more and more entrepreneurs. So what do
you do if you find one in yours? After reading the carefully underlined dates
and deadlines for claims filings, consult a bankruptcy attorney. One of the
many ways a lawyer can help is advising whether you should continue supplying
the customer. If losing the account could bankrupt you, it might not be a bad
idea to continue, at least temporarily, says Howard Ehrenberg, a bankruptcy
specialist and partner with Sulmeyer, Kupetz, Baumann & Rothman, based in Los
Angeles. "The bankruptcy code protects vendors who continue to provide goods
and services after the bankruptcy is filed by giving them the highest
priority," says Ehrenberg.

Ehrenberg also advises participating in the unsecured creditors' committee,
which is usually formed after a company files for bankruptcy. It won't put you
ahead of other unsecured creditors, but the committee has the inside track on
the company's financial status and is empowered to appoint a trustee if
current management is deemed wrong for the job. "The committee helps ensure
that the unsecured creditors are treated fairly," says Ehrenberg. "Without a
voice, the debtor will not likely be able to negotiate a better result."

Business owners like McKay have found that smaller shops get short shrift when
looking to recoup debt. When she learned recently that one of her customers, a
large investment company, was not only bankrupt but also facing criminal
charges, she realized she wasn't getting paid. "If it's a few thousand
compared to $20 million, I'm irrelevant," she says. "But that few thousand
dollars is a weekly payroll for an employee, or several."

An ounce of prevention is still the best cure. Experts agree that the most
important precaution is making sure that you're adequately diversified. If you
place all or even most of your eggs in one customer's basket, your business is
at a tremendous risk, particularly if you've made decisions based on that
customer being there. "If you added a second shift or bought additional
equipment to meet their needs, you could really be in a very difficult
position," says Bruce Kemelgor, professor of entrepreneurship and management
and director of the Small Business Institute at the University of Louisville
in Kentucky.

Be sure to heed the warning signs. Obvious clues are customers taking longer
to pay or not returning phone calls, says Eva Rosenberg, CPA and publisher of
Taxmama.com, a Web site providing free tax information to individuals and
small-business owners. "And their order pattern will change. They're either
ordering a lot more because they know you're not going to give them credit
shortly or a lot less because they're going out of business."

Of course, the easiest way to eliminate risk is to stop extending credit.
Although McKay hasn't stopped extending credit on the retail side for fear of
alienating customers and losing them to bigger players, she has changed
policies on the franchising side, cutting out freebies, encouraging payment
upfront and imposing a finance charge if franchisees finance. Surprisingly,
she says, business is up about 17 percent since the changes started last
December. "I'm not sure why," she says. "Maybe psychologically, if people feel
they're being evaluated in more distinctive terms, maybe they feel it's more
of a value for them."
