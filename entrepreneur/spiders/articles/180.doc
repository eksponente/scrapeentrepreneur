12 Ways Successful People Handle Toxic People

Toxic people defy logic. Some are blissfully unaware of the negative impact
that they have on those around them, and others seem to derive satisfaction
from creating chaos and pushing other people’s buttons. Either way, they
create unnecessary complexity, strife, and worst of all stress.

Studies have long shown that stress can have a lasting, negative impact on the
brain. Exposure to even a few days of stress compromises the effectiveness of
neurons in the hippocampus—an important brain area responsible for reasoning
and memory. Weeks of stress cause reversible damage to neuronal dendrites (the
small “arms” that brain cells use to communicate with each other), and months
of stress can permanently destroy neurons. Stress is a formidable threat to
your success—when stress gets out of control, your brain and your performance
suffer.

Most sources of stress at work are easy to identify. If your non-profit is
working to land a grant that your organization needs to function, you’re bound
to feel stress and likely know how to manage it. It’s the unexpected sources
of stress that take you by surprise and harm you the most.

Recent research from the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology at
Friedrich Schiller University in Germany found that exposure to stimuli that
cause strong negative emotions—the same kind of exposure you get when dealing
with toxic people—caused subjects’ brains to have a massive stress response.
Whether it’s negativity, cruelty, the victim syndrome, or just plain
craziness, toxic people drive your brain into a stressed-out state that should
be avoided at all costs.

The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a
direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more
than a million people, and we’ve found that 90% of top performers are skilled
at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in
control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize toxic
people. Top performers have well-honed coping strategies that they employ to
keep toxic people at bay.

While I’ve run across numerous effective strategies that successful people
employ when dealing with toxic people, what follows are twelve of the best. To
deal with toxic people effectively, you need an approach that enables you,
across the board, to control what you can and eliminate what you can’t. The
important thing to remember is that you are in control of far more than you
realize.

## 1\. They Set Limits (Especially with Complainers)

Complainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their
problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity
party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel
pressure to listen to complainers because they don’t want to be seen as
callous or rude, but there’s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and
getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral.

You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when
necessary. Think of it this way: if the complainer were smoking, would you sit
there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You’d distance yourself,
and you should do the same with complainers. A great way to set limits is to
ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet
down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.

## 2\. They Don’t Die in the Fight

Successful people know how important it is to live to fight another day,
especially when your foe is a toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion
makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you
severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you’re able to
choose your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right.

## 3\. They Rise Above

Toxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no
mistake about it; their behavior truly goes against reason. So why do you
allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix?

The more irrational and off-base someone is, the easier it should be for you
to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own
game. Distance yourself from them emotionally and approach your interactions
like they’re a science project (or you’re their shrink, if you prefer the
analogy). You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos—only the facts.

## 4\. They Stay Aware of Their Emotions

Maintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone
from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening.
Sometimes you’ll find yourself in situations where you’ll need to regroup and
choose the best way forward. This is fine and you shouldn’t be afraid to buy
yourself some time to do so.

Think of it this way—if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the
street and tells you he’s John F. Kennedy, you’re unlikely to set him
straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly
derailed thinking, sometimes it’s best to just smile and nod. If you’re going
to have to straighten them out, it’s better to give yourself some time to plan
the best way to go about it.

## 5\. They Establish Boundaries

This is the area where most people tend to sell themselves short. They feel
like because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the
chaos. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Once you’ve found your way to
Rise Above a person, you’ll begin to find their behavior more predictable and
easier to understand. This will equip you to think rationally about when and
where you have to put up with them and when you don’t. For example, even if
you work with someone closely on a project team, that doesn’t mean that you
need to have the same level of one-on-one interaction with them that you have
with other team members.

You can establish a boundary, but you’ll have to do so consciously and
proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you are bound to find
yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set
boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can
control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep
boundaries in place when the person tries to encroach upon them, which they
will.

## 6\. They Won’t Let Anyone Limit Their Joy

When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from the opinions of
other people, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When
emotionally intelligent people feel good about something that they’ve done,
they won’t let anyone’s opinions or snide remarks take that away from them.

While it’s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you,
you don’t have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people’s
opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what toxic people are
thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what
people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain—you’re
never as good or bad as they say you are.

## 7\. They Don’t Focus on Problems—Only Solutions

Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you
fixate on the problems you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions
and stress. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your
circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive
emotions and reduces stress.

When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are
gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult
person is, and focus instead on how you’re going to go about handling them.
This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce
the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.

## 8\. They Don’t Forget

Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn’t mean
that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what’s happened so that
you can move on. It doesn’t mean you’ll give a wrongdoer another chance.
Successful people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others’
mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting
themselves from future harm.

## 9\. They Squash Negative Self-Talk

Sometimes you absorb the negativity of other people. There’s nothing wrong
with feeling bad about how someone is treating you, but your self-talk (the
thoughts you have about your feelings) can either intensify the negativity or
help you move past it. Negative self-talk is unrealistic, unnecessary, and
self-defeating. It sends you into a downward emotional spiral that is
difficult to pull out of. You should avoid negative self-talk at all costs.

## 10\. They Limit Their Caffeine Intake

Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source
of the “fight-or-flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to
stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-
or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response.
This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re
surprised in the hallway by an angry coworker.

## 11\. They Get Some Sleep

I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the
importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing
your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling
through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes
dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control,
attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right
kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even
without a stressor present.

A good night’s sleep makes you more positive, creative, and proactive in your
approach to toxic people, giving you the perspective you need to deal
effectively with them.

## 12\. They Use Their Support System

It’s tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by
yourself. To deal with toxic people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in
your approach to them. This means tapping into your support system to gain
perspective on a challenging person. Everyone has someone at work and/or
outside work who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them
get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your
life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it.
Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective.
Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they
are not as emotionally invested in the situation.

## Bringing It All Together

Before you get this system to work brilliantly, you’re going to have to pass
some tests. Most of the time, you will find yourself tested by touchy
interactions with problem people. Thankfully, the plasticity of the brain
allows it to mold and change as you practice new behaviors, even when you
fail. Implementing these healthy, stress-relieving techniques for dealing with
difficult people will train your brain to handle stress more effectively and
decrease the likelihood of ill effects.
