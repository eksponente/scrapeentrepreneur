Fit to be Tethered

If you spend much of your life working from hotel rooms in various cities, the
good news is that most of them are now equipped with high-speed Internet
access. The bad news comes at checkout, when you realize that 24-hour
stretches of high-speed Internet at $10.95 actually do add up.

That cost is a good argument for using the local 3G mobile network instead.
However, most laptops still don't have 3G access built in, and most phones are
not always an adequate replacement for a laptop.

Like many business travelers, three guys from Halifax, Nova Scotia--Patrick
Hankinson, his brother Stephen Hankinson and friend Timothy Burke--experienced
this challenge firsthand. To overcome it, they created a tethering application
that allows laptops to tie into a smartphone such as the BlackBerry to use its
3G connection and your existing mobile data service plan as a high-speed
Internet alternative.

"It came out of our own experience--being tired of paying a lot for Internet
access at hotels," said Patrick Hankinson. "We started with the BlackBerry
because we all had BlackBerries."

Their idea gave birth last year to their company,
[TetherBerry](http://tether.com/). By January 2010, the $49.95 app had been
loaded from BlackBerry App World onto more than 70,000 BlackBerries. Some
users undoubtedly were looking to beat hotel fees, but tethering also is
viable anywhere you're out of Wi-Fi range but still within reach of a 3G
signal.

TetherBerry recently changed its name to Tether, and with good reason: It
started offering an Android beta version of the app and is considering
versions for Nokia smartphones and the iPhone.

Though Tether's app doesn't require extra usage fees, strings are attached.
Tethering has to be enabled by carriers, and AT&T, for example, has yet to do
that for the iPhone. But, for an increasing number of smartphone users, hotel
access fees and Wi-Fi availability in general are no longer barriers to when
and where you can use your laptop.
