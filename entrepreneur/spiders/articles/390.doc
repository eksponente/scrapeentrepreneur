7 Ways to Stretch Your Marketing Budget

Marketing isn't just an expense; it's an investment. As an accountant, I often
see businesses spending an incredible amount of money on marketing with very
little return. The key is to market smarter and fully utilize your marketing
budget.

Throwing money at high-dollar advertising venues doesn't provide an automatic
customer base. Consistency is the key to any marketing program and to do that,
businesses need to know how to stretch their limited amount of funds. Here are
7 ways to stretch your marketing dollars and increase your bottom-line
profits:

> **1\. Use free publicity.** It costs you nothing and builds credibility and
awareness. So look for opportunities to be involved with community activities.

>

> **2.** **Speak at local organizations.** Every organization is looking for
speakers for their monthly meetings, so offer to share your knowledge with
them. You'll get exposure to groups as an expert and meet lots of new people
who might be potential clients.

>

> **3\. Write articles for newsletters, newspapers, industry journals and your
own website.** Sharing information builds name recognition, which helps bring
in clients.

>

> **4\. Create a website.** Websites are a must. You're missing a great
opportunity if your business doesn't have a presence on the web. It's a very
cost-effective way of letting people know about you and your products and
services.

>

> **5\. Partner with others.** Look for businesses with complementary services
to create cooperative advertising campaigns so that you have a pool of
dollars.

>

> **6\. Look at ways that you can get more involved in the organizations you
already work with.** This helps build your name recognition by being involved
on committees.

>

> **7\. Networking is the most effective way to meet people.** People like to
do business with others they know. Networking takes very few dollars, but it
does take a time commitment because you must be consistent in your networking
efforts.

Marketing is an important part of any business operation. The challenge is
finding cost-effective ways to get your name out without going over your
allotted budget. Strategic planning is important so that you have a purpose
with each marketing dollar you spend. Some people will just randomly select
marketing activities, which is a huge waste of dollars. Creating a marketing
plan that incorporates the above seven tips will help you have a focus and a
variety of venues to reach existing and potential clients and keep your
financial picture on track.
