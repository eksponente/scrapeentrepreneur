Why Students Absolutely Should Create Startups

I’ve realized I am very much in a bubble. Everyone I know is building a
company. Amongst my circle of friends, that is the norm. This, however, is
mostly out of choice: I believe, in agreement with Seth Godin, that to be an
outlier is an inefficient way to make progress:

> "The easiest way to thrive as an outlier is to avoid being one. At least
among your most treasured peers. Surround yourself with people in at least as
much of a hurry, at least as inquisitive, at least as focused as you are."

With that said, there was a time when I felt out of place. I was studying
Computer Science, and all of my friends were making their choices about what
to do after graduation. All events and advice were centered around either
getting a job, or continuing on to further education. Those were the two
options. The only options you’d find. I had other things in my mind. I was
considering building my own business, creating a startup. A third option.

I fundamentally believe that this elusive third option should be talked about
much more. I think there needs to be higher awareness that creating a startup
is a real, tangible option for increasing numbers of students. It’s one of the
reasons I speak at college and university events as often as I speak at some
of the bigger scale events with more marketing potential. I hope to inspire a
few people to take the **third option**.

## My story of choosing the third option

During my time studying, I was always doing side projects and freelance work.
By the time I was approaching graduation, I had worked as a freelancer on the
side for several years. As a result of my side projects and practical
assignments, I had decided that I’d like to create a product: (something much
more scalable and with my income not tied to time) instead of continuing
freelance work or getting a regular job.

So, after graduation, I took the plunge and tried to create my own startup.
The third option. It’s certainly [not a smooth path](http://open.bufferapp.com
/feel-uncomfortable/), it’s not the easy option. For some, it may never work
out.

For the next year and a half, I struggled to build a startup while I still
worked as a freelancer to make ends meet. From the outside it may have seemed
that I was not going anywhere. I made little progress with my startup, and I
intentionally limited time I spent working as a freelancer. Yet, that’s how it
works with startups: it’s the [bamboo effect](http://leostartsup.com/2012/10
/growing-like-bamboo/). You’re accumulating learning. Suddenly it all comes
together and you have an impact.

After a year and a half of struggles with the first startup, I launched a
little experiment called Buffer. Two years later, it’s a 25-person company
generating over a million dollars a year. I would like to say I would always
have got here, but I know in my mind I was close to being influenced by the
fact there were only two obvious choices for me. I luckily found a way to
choose that third option that fewer people talk about.

## The upside of doing a startup

Building a startup is not for everyone. If, however, you think this path might
be for you, I want to share some of the amazing benefits to my life that I’ve
found as a result of choosing the third option.

One of the things I like the most about building a startup is the immense
freedom and responsibility that results. This is also true if you work for an
early stage startup -- and that could be a good first step, too. The other
side of the coin of this freedom and responsibility is that the choice of
[whether to get out of bed and keep going](https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-
myth-of-passion-and-motivation-how-to-stay-focused-when-you-get-bored-working-
toward-your-goals) is only up to you. For me, this triggered a spiritual
journey, where I have learned more about myself and what motivates me. It’s
also why I’m always changing my routine and habits.

The more direct upside is through learning and the potential to have your
income not be tied to your time, you can build wealth in a very short period
of time. Paul Graham explained this in the best way [I’ve come
across](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html):

> “Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole
working life into a few years.”

What Paul Graham is talking about takes hard work, but is achievable. A
regular job doesn’t require too many hard conversations, or making decisions
without complete information. This is what makes a startup harder. Paul Graham
once again has a great way to put this:

> “If you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million
dollars’ worth of pain”

It’s a fun way to live. I’ve never learned as much in a couple of years as I
have building Buffer. I can definitely recommend it.

## The opportunity cost of working a normal job

I have come to believe that not only is there a massive upside to building a
startup, there is also an opportunity cost of working a regular job. That is
to say – if you have the goal to eventually build a startup, then every moment
you spend working a regular job is making you less experienced as a startup
founder.

Why would this be the case? Well, firstly, let’s look at the lifestyle
implications of a regular job. A lot of smart folks will graduate and have
good prospects of working at in investment banking or at a consultancy, and
the salary potential is very high. So you get started and you have a nice
apartment. Once you get a raise, you naturally upgrade your lifestyle. You
soon reach a point where you have a lot to lose by cutting your salary in half
or to nothing.

Not only is it very easy to get used to the lifestyle promoted by the salary
and the people you are around, you also learn to speak in a way which helps
you as an investment banker, but not necessarily when you’re building a
product or service for the masses. Most importantly, you are becoming an
expert of something, and thereby losing the beginner’s mind which is vital to
have as a startup founder.

## Let’s encourage the third option

As a result of my own experience and the interaction I’ve had with students
who could have been great founders, I believe the most useful thing we can all
do is to provide encouragement for anyone who shows the smallest sign of
considering the path of being a startup founder. Sure, there are risks and
there will be failure, but there is immense learning and satisfaction ahead
for those who choose the third option.

Anyone can point out the dangers, that’s the easy thing to do. Let us be
positive about the good things that could happen. Will you join me?
