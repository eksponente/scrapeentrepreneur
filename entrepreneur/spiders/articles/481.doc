When Lease Is More

_Entrepreneur_ magazine, September 1999

One way to keep equipment costs down is to lease rather than buy. These days,
just about anything can be leased--from computers and heavy machinery to
complete offices. The kind of business you're in and the type of equipment
you're considering are major factors in determining whether to lease or buy.
If you're starting a one-person business and only need one computer, for
instance, it probably makes more sense to buy. On the other hand, if you're
opening an office that will have several employees and require several
computers, you may want to look into leasing.

According to the Equipment Leasing Association (ELA), approximately 80 percent
of U.S. companies lease some or all of their equipment, and there are
thousands of equipment-leasing firms nationwide catering to that demand.
"Leasing is an excellent hedge against obsolescence," explains Laurie Kusek of
the ELA, "especially if you're leasing something like computer equipment and
want to update it constantly."

Other leasing advantages include: lower monthly payments than you would have
with a loan; a fixed financing rate instead of a floating rate; tax
advantages; conservation of working capital and no cash-devouring down
payments; and immediate access to the most up-to-date business tools.

One drawback to leasing, however, is that you'll probably pay a higher price
in the long run than you would have with a straight purchase. You may also
have to retain the equipment for a certain period of time--a difficulty if
your business is in flux.
