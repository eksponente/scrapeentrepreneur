The Risks of Accepting Checks

Q: I'm opening a business and want to know what kind of check policy I should
have. If someone bounces a check, do I lose the money? How can I protect
myself against fraud and returned checks? How does accepting checks over the
Internet differ from accepting paper checks? Do the same rules apply?

A: To help prevent returned checks, follow these fraud-prevention tips from
experts such as the National Crime Prevention Council, the National Check
Fraud Center and Bankrate.com:

  * Always ask to see the check writer's driver's license or identification card. Compare the signature and the address on the card with the information on the check. A photo ID is even better.
  * Ask the purchaser to sign the check in your presence and compare it with the signature on the identification.
  * Accepting check cards, such as MasterCard's Master Money Card and the Visa Check Card, may actually be safer than taking paper checks. A check card is an instantaneous debit from the purchaser's bank account, while paper checks can take up to 14 days to clear. In addition, the billing address on the check card can be verified with the Address Verification Service, the same system used to verify addresses for credit cards.
  * Never accept a double-endorsed check, which is a check made out to someone else, who then supposedly signs it over to the person who submits it as his or her payment for a purchase.
  * Never accept payroll checks.
  * Watch for checks with low numbers. Nine out of 10 bad checks bear numbers from 101 to 499, which usually indicates a new account.
  * Look for apparent alterations in the check (e.g., changes in the handwriting, water spots, color or background picture). This could mean it's a forgery.
  * Don't accept pre-dated or post-dated checks. The funds may not be available in the account when you try to deposit it.
  * Compare the last three or four digits of the Federal Reserve number in the right-hand corner of the check with the first three or four digits of the routing and transit numbers on the bottom left of the check. They should match.
  * Establish a waiting period for refunds. Make certain your customer's check clears before refunding the money.

**Guarantee Your Money**  
Checks are most frequently returned for nonsufficient funds or closed bank
accounts. If you accept checks as payment for goods and or services and you
want to ensure that you receive your funds, you may want to contract with a
check guarantee service. If your credit card processor is a one-stop-shop
transaction processing company, signing up for check guarantee services is as
simple as checking off a box on your merchant application.

With a check guarantee service, you run your customer's check through your
point-of-sale terminal, which connects directly to the check guarantee
service. The service reviews its database of good and bad check writers, and
if your customer does not appear in the negative database, you can probably
accept the check. Keep in mind, this review does not guarantee that there are
sufficient funds to cover the check. If it bounces, your bank account will be
debited for the full amount. But you can then submit the check for
reimbursement, following the service's specific criteria, and they will
reimburse you for that bad check.

**Internet Checks**  
Virtual checks, an online payment option rapidly growing in popularity,
present some additional challenges. Because this is a non-face-to-face
transaction, you can't ask for a driver's license to compare the signature.
There is no signature-only the consumer's online agreement. And because it is
not a physical check, you can't look for the inconsistencies mentioned
earlier. To protect yourself from Internet fraud, don't ship the merchandise
until the virtual check clears.

**Check Policy**  
Post your check policy in full view of your customers-whether it's a brick-
and-mortar environment or your Web site. Make certain your customers are aware
they will be charged a penalty if they bounce a check. Establish a policy that
fits your company, and make certain your employees understand and implement
it. Each state has specific laws about fines and fees for returned checks.
Merchants should verify and post these laws where customers can see them.

Check acceptance boosts sales; _safe_ check acceptance is a matter of being
careful. Investing in a check guarantee service is a business strategy that
you must evaluate for your needs. But even if you don't select one of these
services, be cautious on the front end: When your customer issues you a check,
be sure to confirm his or her identification, telephone numbers, addresses,
the MICR code numbers and the signature on the check. This may save you from
financial loss.
