The Tech Surge That's Putting Consumers in the Forefront

When I was at Pepsi-Cola in the early part of my career, producers were in
control. In the late 1970s, this was the era of mass marketing when national
network television could reach virtually every American household. Dominant
companies could protect their brand franchises with heavy levels of
advertising because [customers

producers told them.

Right now, a surge of incredible new technologies are expanding at an
exponential rate and driving a change. Thanks to big data, cloud computing and
an explosion of miniature sensors as well as mobile devices, customers are
becoming smarter and smarter.

Consumers are sharing opinions, reviewing products and making referrals on a
huge scale. Now customers trust other customers more than they trust
producers. While this is only the beginning of the big-data marketing era, the
power shift to the customer is irreversible and the implications for
traditional corporations are daunting. But the opportunities for entrepreneurs
to disrupt and build companies have never been better.

As these powerful technologies grow, they are dramatically driving down costs.
With [40 billion miniaturized, wireless sensors
projected](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227341/IoT-enabled-devices-
to-cross-40-billion-by-2020) to arrive by the early 2020s, machine-to-machine
communications will be possible, with human intervention not required. This
will allow for new end-to-end business processes, along with smart robots,
that will significantly reduce costs. For the innovators who embrace
technology, disruptive pricing opportunities will be created as never before.
But traditional corporations with a high overhead structure that are unwilling
to adapt will be put at a high risk.

The other huge opportunity for entrepreneurs is to create an incredible
customer experience. I like to call this a showstopping customer experience,
one that's so good that the clients become a company's promoters. They use
every means of communication from voice, the Internet, text and social-media
platforms to tell others. Think about a customer's experience at the Apple’s
Genius Bar or the concierge service at the Four Seasons Hotel, for example.

What's really exciting and offering the biggest opportunity for entrepreneurs
is to combine a spectacular customer experience with a disruptive price. This
has happened before and transformed huge industries. When Sam Walton created
Wal-Mart, he focused on a low-price strategy, based upon outsourcing, highly
automated warehouses and nonunion labor that his competitors could not match.
He also added friendly greeters to the front of his stores to welcome shoppers
and make them feel special.

Now Wal-Mart and other retailers are in the cross hairs of Amazon and may
themselves face disruption. Jeff Bezos has created fulfillment centers using
cutting-edge technology, including robotics, to reduce costs to unthinkable
levels. He has combined this brilliantly to create a customer experience
driven by big-data analytics running on powerful cloud-computing systems in an
attempt to predict the products and services each individual customer wants.

And Amazon is building supply centers all around the country with the aim of
eventually providing same-day service. The company is even diving into fresh
food. Amazon wants to be the supplier of everything. In the end, Amazon's
power is all about customer satisfaction: giving customers an exceptional
experience with convenient ordering, a huge assortment of products, delivered
quickly to their homes and at a disruptively low price.

Another sector that I believe is ripe for disruption is the shaving industry.
For the big companies, technology has allowed for a very high-quality shave,
especially with five-blade razors. But these market leaders have priced their
products so high that customers are unhappy. And due to these high prices,
many retailers lock up their razor aisles to prevent pilfering, making the
shopping experience inconvenient. Consumers put up with these issues, however,
because they want a great shave.

I am an investor in a new online company, 800razors.com. Unlike several other
online major companies that source cheap imported razors, the company sells
quality razors made in America similar to those of the big brands for about
half the price and with free shipping. Customers have become active promoters.
Time will tell if the company has the right ingredients for disruption.

Creating a stellar customer experience requires companies to put consumers at
the center of everything. Combine that with disruptive pricing and this opens
up the opportunity for entrepreneurs to build huge, disruptive businesses.
