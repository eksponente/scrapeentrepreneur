A New Twist on Index Funds

Index mutual funds are as simple as they are cheap, with returns that outpace
a majority of the investing public every year. What's not to like?

Plenty, for those who consider themselves value players--investors who prefer
out-of-favor sectors or beaten-down stocks. Because indexes like the S&P 500
are ranked by companies' market caps, index mutual funds tend to boost the
weight of well-to-do companies and decrease that of struggling ones. Some say
traditional index funds follow a de facto growth strategy rather than a value
one. To rectify this, WisdomTree Investments and Research Affiliates launched
twists on the index-fund concept with fundamental indexing. The idea is to peg
an index to something other than stock prices. WisdomTree's Total Dividend
Fund, for example, includes NYSE, Amex and Nasdaq global stocks that pay
regular dividends. As an exchange-traded fund, it charges 0.28 percent in
expenses--more than the 0.19 percent charged by a traditional indexer like
Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund, but less than the expenses of
actively managed options.

WisdomTree promotes its fundamental indexing with ETFs (30 at last count)
pegged to stocks within a particular sector that pay dividends. Research
Affiliates works through pension funds or other firms. But its idea of using
"financial, price-indifferent measures of company size to weight stocks in an
index" will surely catch on.

Should you bite? If you own a Wilshire 5000 fund like Vanguard's Total Stock
Market VIPERS Fund already, probably not. But for an S&P 500 fund or a sector-
specific index, maybe. Do some research and watch how they perform.
