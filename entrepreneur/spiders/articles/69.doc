Tablet PCs That Mean Business

Tablet PCs--touchscreen computers that bridge the gap between paper notepads
and laptops--are all over the local news lately thanks to the iPad, which
threatens to revolutionize portable computing when it arrives April 3. But as
is evidenced by the impending debut of [HP's EliteBook 2740p](http://h10010.ww
w1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/321957-321957-64295-3740645-3955549-4145567.html
), a multi-touch tablet designed specifically with commercial applications in
mind, plenty of other manufacturers in the space besides Apple mean business.

Just as [Lenovo's IdeaPad U1](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/landing_pages/products
/new-product-showcase) netbook/ultra-portable PC hybrid and [Archos' 7 and 8
Home Tablets](http://www.archos.com/products/ht/index.html?country=gb&lang=en)
(designed for casual Web and online-connected multimedia consumption) aim to
innovate within the space, so too does the EliteBook 2740p offer several novel
twists. Users can simply rotate the device's 12.1-inch display for easier use
and viewing, and activate or control on-screen programs with a tap of a finger
or stylus. Multi-touch commands make it easier to browse and navigate using
multiple digits, with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity also built in. Road
warriors will further enjoy the benefit of outdoor viewing options that
mitigate the effects of glare, as well as a durable case and shockproof
features that protect the hard drive from inadvertent drops or jostles. A
fingerprint sensor is also offered along with data encryption options for
greater file security.

Running on the Windows 7 operating system, owners can opt to cram in low-
voltage Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, up to 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SATA II
or 160GB solid state drive into the machine. That's enough to power the vast
majority of business applications, with wireless connectivity advanced enough
to grab bandwidth from any conference room or Wi-Fi hotspot. In addition,
quick boot-up options let you speedily access your e-mail, contacts, calendar
and the internet without going through a lengthy startup process, saving on
time and aggravation and allowing you to boost productivity. While it won't
win any awards for industrial design, and overall graphics capability is
underwhelming, the device's portability (it weighs in at 3.8 pounds and
measures 14.7 by 9.9 by 1.28 inches) and flexibility offset these drawbacks.

Lacking the iPad's pure wow factor (don't expect stunning multimedia
performance or dedicated e-reader functionality) or the pedigree of
Microsoft's long-rumored dual-screen "Courier" tablet, the EliteBook 2740p may
be less glamorous than its rivals. But with five to 11 hours of battery life,
the ability to take a beating and enough horsepower to more than handle the
average entrepreneur's typical workload, let's be realistic: It may cost a
pretty penny, with prices starting at $1,599 when the device ships in April
along with sister product the HP EliteBook 2540p ($1099), but for small
business owners (especially those in the areas of healthcare, education and
sales) looking for a custom, gesture-tracking solution that packs in more
power and greater screen real estate than can be found on smartphones, it
delivers.

Not only does the system point toward rising interest in the tablet computing
category across the board from manufacturers from Gateway to Acer, possibly
leading to a renaissance for the field as a whole. As is evidenced by its
suitability for use with commercial endeavors, there's also ample reason for
entrepreneurs to reach out and touch one.
