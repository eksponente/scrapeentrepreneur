What's It Worth?

If there's easily recognizable value somewhere, anywhere, in your business,
you can generally get a loan against it to help fund the growth of your
company.

This is the fundamental idea behind so-called asset-based loans--a potent
source of funding for established small businesses, according to William
Barnett, an attorney with the law firm Herrick, Feinstein LLP in New York City
who specializes in asset-based lending. Specifically, he says, "Asset-based
lending is formula lending based on the liquidation value of accounts
receivable and inventory."

While lenders making term loans (loans that are paid back over a span of two
to five years) certainly consider the value of these assets, value is only a
secondary consideration. For the most part, when a banker makes a term loan,
he or she is looking at the cash flow of the enterprise and trying to
determine whether it is sufficient to service the debt and whether it can be
sustained for the term of the loan.

Asset-based lenders, on the other hand, have a dual focus. They, too, look at
cash flow, but they also look at two asset classes--accounts receivable and
inventory--in terms of their ability to be liquidated to pay off the loan if
the cash flow goes south. Short-term asset-based loans generally get paid off
as accounts receivable and inventory liquidate.

In growing businesses, however, more accounts receivable and inventory are
being generated all the time. As a result of this cycle, an asset-based loan
has a revolving quality to it. This can be a good thing because it gives a
company time to catch its breath. But it can also work to a company's
disadvantage. If an asset-based loan isn't renewed by the lender, for example,
the company may be forced to pay the borrowed money back before it's prepared
to do so.

An asset-based lender's emphasis on assets rather than cash flow makes a
significant impact on the relationship between lender and borrower, according
to Barnett.

The asset-based lender is taking a so-called security position in the
underlying assets and views liquidation of them as a viable means of
recovering the loan principal. In addition, because the asset-based lender is
lending against assets, which can rapidly fluctuate in value, it monitors
these assets more intensively. "It's not uncommon for asset-based lenders to
look at a company's inventory or accounts receivable once a month, sometimes
even more frequently," says Barnett. Conventional lenders making term loans,
on the other hand, might review financial data just once a quarter and never
look at inventory after the initial loan is made.

**Adding Up Your Assets**

Your borrowing capacity for an asset-based loan rests on what your assets will
support and the maximum line a lender will grant you. Barnett says most asset-
based lenders will lend 80 percent of "eligible" receivables and 50 percent of
"eligible" inventory. So what do we mean by eligible?

Basically, just because you have an asset on the books doesn't necessarily
mean a lender will advance you funds against it. "Asset-based lenders deduct
ineligible receivables such as those from mom-and-pop shops, those from
customers who have had a bad debt on prior receivables, ones that are more
than 90 days old or, perhaps, receivables due from customers overseas," says
Barnett.

So on the receivables side, the equation looks like this:

The same concept applies to inventory. That is, the inventory on hand needs to
be adjusted by the lender. Specifically, ineligible components must be removed
to estimate the eligible portion. Ineligible inventory might include items
that are obsolete, certain exotic goods that would be difficult to liquidate,
perishables that may spoil before they can be liquidated or materials that are
damaged. The inventory equation is as follows:

Barnett says adding the two sums together and subtracting any outstanding debt
gives you the amount you can borrow, as long as it doesn't exceed the total
line available to your company, which is spelled out in your agreement with
the lender.

Why does inventory get such a low advance rate, just 50 percent of eligible
inventory, while accounts receivable gets 80 percent of the eligible amount?
According to Timothy Gannon, senior vice president of the asset-based group at
Sterling National Bank, a publicly held New York City bank that specializes in
small- and middle-market companies, "Accounts receivable are self-liquidating,
while inventory is not. If a lender needs to liquidate to recover the loan, it
will have to take possession of the inventory and sell it, which can be
difficult, time consuming and expensive." By contrast, he says, the majority
of a company's accounts receivable will, over time (hopefully in 30 days),
turn themselves into cash through payments from customers.
