before you start a freight brokerage business._

The dissolution of the Interstate Commerce Commission and other aspects of
transportation deregulation have left many people confused about what's
regulated and what's not. Here's what you need to know about the regulatory
and practical requirements of being a freight broker.

**1\. Legal issues**

Freight brokers must register with the [Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration](http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/) (FMCSA). Essentially, you file an
application (form OP-1) and pay a filing fee, obtain a $75,000 surety bond or
establish a trust fund, and designate agents for service of legal process. The
registration will remain valid as long as these requirements continue to be
met.

The surety bond or trust fund is evidence of financial responsibility. This
means you must demonstrate you have access to that amount of liquid assets to
meet your obligations and pay any potential claims. You can either use your
own resources or contract with a bonding company. Evidence of a surety bond
must be filed using form BMC 84; evidence of a trust fund with a financial
institution must be filed using form BMC 85.

Designation of process agents means that for each state in which you have
offices or in which you write contracts, you must file a designation of person
on whom court process may be served.

When your application is approved, you’ll receive a permit with an MC number
from the FHWA that's your authority to operate as a broker within the United
States. Beyond the regulations that govern your particular operation, when you
act on behalf of a person bound by law or FHWA regulations as to the
transmittal of bills or payments, you must also abide by the laws or
regulations that apply to that person.

In addition to federal requirements, you’ll need whatever business licenses
and/or operational permits that are required by your local and state
governments. Check with your local planning and zoning department or
city/county business license department to find out what you need.

**2\. Get experience**

Experienced brokers recommend working in the industry—either for a shipper, a
carrier or both—before starting your own brokerage. You’ll not only gain
technical expertise, but you’ll also make contacts that are critical to
success in this business.

Freight broker Cathy Davis entered the industry as an inventory control clerk
for a river terminal, then spent time working in sales for motor and air
freight carriers. Her consulting business gave her the opportunity to learn
even more about being a broker; she was an agent for brokers before becoming
one herself, which gave her both hands-on experience and an opportunity to
build her reputation.

**3\. Financial management**

It’s important to understand the economics of the trucking business when you
negotiate payment terms with your carriers. In the past, ICC regulations
dictated that freight bills be paid within seven days; today, since
deregulation, that's negotiable. But carriers operate on very narrow margins
and pay most of their expenses on a given load before they ever pick it up, so
cash flow is as critical to them as it is to the broker.

Some brokers would prefer not to have to pay the carrier until they get paid
themselves, but you won’t find carriers very enthusiastic about it. “Carriers
take the stand that the reason they're using a broker is so they don’t have to
do credit checks on the customers or do the sales and service that we
provide,” says freight broker Bill Tucker. “It’s one of the reasons the
carriers will sell to you a little lower than they would bill the shipper
direct.”

**4\. Banking on your banker**

Solid banking relationships are critical for brokers. It’s not unusual for a
new broker to need a line of credit in the range of $250,000 to $300,000 to be
able to pay carriers before being paid by the shippers. If you don’t pay the
truckers in a timely fashion, they won’t haul your freight. If you have nobody
to haul your freight, you have no business.

Of course, you don’t want to walk empty-handed into a bank you’ve never done
business with and ask for a major line of credit. Put together a professional
package including a complete business plan that clearly demonstrates to the
bank that you’re not a credit risk and that they’ll benefit by establishing a
line of credit for you. Be sure to take your package to a commercial loan
officer, not someone who handles personal accounts. Get a referral from
someone who's a good customer.

In these days of banking mergers and acquisitions, along with personnel
turnover, it’s a good idea to have relationships with more than one bank. If
you have a single line of credit and the bank gets sold, you could find your
line of credit canceled. Or if you have a strong relationship with a loan
officer who gets promoted, transferred, or changes jobs, you may find the new
loan officer not as receptive to your needs. Make sure you have a financial
backup to turn to.

**5\. Record-keeping requirements**

The Code of Federal Regulations is very specific about what types of records
you must maintain. You're required to keep a record of each transaction. That
record must show:

  * the name and address of the consignor (shipper)
  * the name, address and registration number of the originating motor carrier
  * the bill of lading or freight bill number
  * the amount of compensation received by the broker for the brokerage service performed and the name of the payer
  * a description of any nonbrokerage service performed in connection with each shipment or other activity, the amount of compensation received for the service, and the name of the payer
  * the amount of any freight charges collected by the broker and the date of payment to the carrier

You must keep these records for a period of three years, and each party to a
particular transaction has a right to review the records relating to that
transaction.
