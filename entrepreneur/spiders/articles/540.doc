Rita Alvy-Teeter came into work one bright spring day last year to find a
third of the revenue pulled out from under her Irvine, California, design
firm.

The loss of just one large client hit the paychecks of the president and her
partners immediately, and put [Drive Industries Design
Group](http://www.driveindustries.com), which projects $800,000 in 2005 sales,
in survival mode. Purchases got postponed, paper clips got counted, and some
of the seven-person boutique's outside contractors didn't get contracts.
Summer 2004 was spent rustling up approximately 30 new clients to replace that
one big revenue-generator. Alvy-Teeter herself had to spend more time CEO-ing
than sketching.

The good news: She and board member Tammy Ross-Stern, a CPA with Beckman
Kirkland & Whitney in Westlake Village, California, had a diversification plan
in hand. Being a regular user of QuickBooks accounting software, Alvy-Teeter
had a down-to-the-penny understanding of her firm's financial position--
income, bills, cash on hand, jobs in the pipeline and discretionary expenses
(see "Book 'Em, Dano,"). "We wouldn't have survived without daily monitoring
of cash flow," says Alvy-Teeter, 48.

Like they say: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. This year, Drive
replaced those 30 stopgap clients with 10 higher-revenue, higher-profit
clients appropriately diversified.

#### Good Times and Bad

Bad things are going to happen to nice businesses. But growing numbers of
entrepreneurs are using PC-based accounting to stay close enough to their
books to survive inevitable downturns-and make the most of good times.

John Garrett, 43, can't imagine trying to steer [Triad Distributing
Northwest](http://www.triad-dist.com) to profit without daily reports from
Peachtree Accounting. The seven-person building product distributor in Garden
City, Idaho, projects $2.2 million in 2005 sales and regularly inventories
more than 7,000 stock-keeping units with varying gross margins, sales cycles
and restocking schedules. Many are used in combination, so the founder and co-
president has to carefully orchestrate the arrival of subassemblies to keep
Triad's average profit margin from slipping.

Yet one large customer demands prices and features that leave Triad's gross
margins below acceptable levels. But doing business with that company still
makes sense because Peachtree shows its inventory turning far faster than
others, explains Garrett, so Triad gets a return on the same dollar invested
more times a year than with other lines.

Another familiar challenge: passing sudden cost increases on to customers--
including not-so-obvious costs. It isn't the expected fluctuations in
wholesale coffee prices that hurt Atlanta-based bean roaster [Partners
Coffee](http://www.partnerscoffee.com). Even though the $3.5 million-a-year
wholesaler's selling prices are locked in by contract, founder and CEO Jim
Gilson, 50, can minimize those impacts by hedging coffee futures on the
Chicago Board of Trade. But sudden jumps in other components of his "cost of
goods sold" line are a different story.

"When crude oil goes to $55 a barrel, I can take a 12 percent to 18 percent
hit on my corrugated [boxes] and plastic packaging," says the founder of the
15-person firm. "I have no way to pass those costs on while contracts are in
place. They come out of my margin."

But worse than knowing how much money you're losing is not knowing. Just
before negotiating his next sales contract, Gilson pulls his most current
costs out of Peachtree. Similarly, QuickBooks alerts Frank Toledano, 33,
president of Tiger Imports Group of Highpoint, North Carolina, when it's time
to discontinue one of his 100 different styles of high--end Italian leathers.
The minimum hide purchase is more than $10,000, so the $5 million-a-year
importer can't afford to keep lines that turn too slowly.

#### Look Ma, No Bookkeeping

You don't have to waste time entering debits and credits to use an accounting
program. CPAs advise having in-house clerical workers or a part-time
bookkeeping service enter data. You don't have to become a CPA, either. It's
cheaper to let your accountant set up your books and consult on complex
accounting matters.

Maintain internal control of your own books, and tap them for quick answers,
says Diane C. O. Gilson, founder of Info Plus Accounting. Her Ann Arbor,
Michigan, firm provides all the traditional CPA services. But Gilson prefers
to set up clients on QuickBooks for routine tasks. Her website
([www.infoplusacct.com](http://www.infoplusacct.com)) also includes a variety
of QuickBooks add-ons to help with more sophisticated types of business
analysis."You don't have to be a large company to have a complex accounting
challenge," explains Gilson.

Are you making full use of your accounting and business data? Your books are
the one source no competitor can share--information far more relevant to your
company's situation than anything else. Salted away in your accounting records
are financial alerts, ways to trim costs and tips on where profit is hiding.

You'll generate the data anyway, so why not turn it into profits?
