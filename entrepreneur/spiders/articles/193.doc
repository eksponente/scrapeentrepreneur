Tax Deductions for Homebased Entrepreneurs

Q: My business is homebased-operating out of my home. Am I entitled to any
[business tax deductions](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219474) as a
result of that?

A: Yes. You are entitled to the normal business tax deductions wherever you
operate your business. In fact, because your business is homebased, you may be
entitled to take a special home-office deduction, but even if you don't
qualify to take this deduction, you may still deduct the "ordinary and
necessary" expenses that apply to the operation of your business.

How the owner takes a home-office deduction is to some degree a function of
the business's legal form of business organization. There are three ways a
small-business owner can consider qualifying for a home-office deduction: (1)
If the business is operating as a either a sole proprietorship or a one-member
Limited Liability Company (LLC); (2) if the business is operating either as a
partnership or a multimember LLC, electing to be taxed as a partnership; or
(3) when the owner of the business is also considered an employee of the
business-as in the case of C and S corporations or an LLC, electing to be
taxed as a corporation.

The next consideration in qualifying to take a home-office deduction is that
you must be using a portion of your home for your business, and be doing so on
both a regular and exclusive basis. "Regular" means that you use a specific
area continuously, as opposed to occasionally or incidentally. "Exclusive"
means that either you do not use this specific space for personal use, or if
you do, that you pro-rate between personal and business use.

The third element in qualifying is that this home office is your principal
place of business-used regularly and exclusively for business, and that you
have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative and
management activities of your business.

If you qualify to take a home-office deduction, you will be entitled to the
following deductions, pro-rated between personal and business use:
depreciation on the house, home mortgage interest and real estate taxes (or
rent), home insurance, utilities, wages for domestic help and local phone
service (excluding your basic service).

Whether or not you qualify to take a home-office deduction, you are entitled
to take the following "ordinary and necessary" business tax deductions:
professional services (such as accounting, attorney and consulting services),
logistical support (alarm systems, cleaning, long-distance phone service,
office supplies, postage, shipping, printing, repairs and maintenance), the
cost of financial services (such as bank service charges), your car, your
office equipment, furniture and fixtures, travel, entertainment, retirement,
hiring your family, tax-free owner benefits (such as health insurance
coverage), wages and salaries, marketing, insurance, payroll taxes and other
non-income taxes.

You cannot, however, take home-office deductions that create a loss during a
current tax year. After the business's taxable income has been reduced to zero
(by taking all allowable business tax deductions), any remaining unused
business tax deductions (referred to as a net operating loss, or NOL) can be
carried back, to reduce the previous year's business income, and forward, to
reduce the future year's taxable business income. This process can continue
until the entire NOL has been used up. Note: This limitation does not apply to
the "ordinary and necessary" business tax deductions, meaning that after these
deductions reduce your taxable business income to zero, they can be applied as
reductions of your other (personal) taxable income.
