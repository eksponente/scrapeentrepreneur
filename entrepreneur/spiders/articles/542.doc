Name Your Price

Jeannette Doellgast spends a lot of time thinking about numbers. She has been
doing so for more than a year, ever since she and her husband and business
partner, Mohsen Alam El Din, bought the [Plumbush
Inn](http://www.plumbushinn.net/) in breathtakingly scenic Cold Spring, New
York. For Alam El Din, 50, born in Egypt and entrenched for 20 years in the
restaurant industry, running his own company is his American Dream. Doellgast,
44, gamely switched careers to join him-after about 15 years as an executive
in the textiles industry, and a three-year stint as an elementary school
teacher. With the bed-and-breakfast, she soon found herself immersed in the
art and science of setting prices.

First, Doellgast concluded that they would have to raise all the prices for
both the rooms and food at the Plumbush Inn, which had been in existence for
30 years when the couple bought it. Long-time customers weren't pleased, and
they made sure to let Doellgast and Alam El Din know it. "It was a risk,"
admits Doellgast.

It has paid off. The Plumbush Inn stands to bring in $1.25 million by the end
of 2005. Considering that Doellgast and Alam El Din paid $1 million for the
business-with a matrix of many loans and all their life savings-they appear to
be off to a good start.

As you likely know or suspect, you'll have many motives when deciding the
prices for your products and services, from understanding what the market can
bear to figuring out what you can bear. It may be that you want to serve
customers with modest incomes, or perhaps you aspire to a level of greatness
that demands high prices. As Doellgast herself observes, "It's instinctive and
emotional, but part of it is also tangible." In elaborating on that point, she
adds: "Oil bills go up every year, electric bills. Expenses are continually
rising."

Watching inflation reports and making sense of what's going on in the market
can make new entrepreneurs wonder what they should charge for their products
and services. And you _should_ wonder. If you don't, and you come up with your
fees lightly, you yourself may end up paying the hefty price.
