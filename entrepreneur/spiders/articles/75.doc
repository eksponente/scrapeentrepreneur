Groupon Gets Up On the Localization Game. Finally!?

For a company that is built on local, it's seems a bit late for the [daily-
deal company](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/daily-deal-sites)
[Groupon](http://www.groupon.com/) to be brushing up on its localization
services.

Better late than never.

Chicago-based Groupon turns five this year -- and what a tumultuous first few
years it's been. To celebrate its birthday, the daily deal site is rolling out
a redesigned website and mobile experience. Now, as you travel with your
mobile device, Groupon's app will automatically send you daily deals for
wherever you happen to be. If you live in New York City, for example, but
travel to Atlanta, the Groupon app will track your travel and then send you
deals for Atlanta. The app will follow you internationally, too.

Prior to today's rollout, Groupon users would have to manually enter their
location to pull up local deals, says Nick Halliwell, spokesperson for
Groupon. Alternatively, users would have had to manually click over to the
"nearby" icon on their screen when they changed locations. "Generally, all of
these changes are intended to make Groupon an even more personalized and
searchable experience for shoppers," he says.

Should any user fret about having Groupon know his or her location at all
times, there is an option in the profile settings of the app to turn off the
geo-location tracking, says Halliwell.

Also as part of the website redesign, your Groupon computer homepage will be
personalized and curated with deals based on your own interests. Groupon will
take note of what you have purchased in the past and what other similar users
have purchased to make recommendations.

It's been a volatile few years for Groupon, with the stock price swinging from
$26 a share to below $3 a share and [the company ousting founder, Andrew

has a new CEO, Eric Lefkofsky](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227756),
and Groupon, despite its challenges, has a pretty impressive reach: The apps
have been downloaded in 43 countries by more than 50 million people.
