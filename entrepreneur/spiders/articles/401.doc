Find Unsecured Loans and Credit Lines

Question: Every bank I talk to about a credit line wants me to personally sign
the loan. Can I get a loan that won't hold me personally liable for what
happens to my company?



Answer: Entrepreneurs often have a tough time getting [small business
loans](http://www.entrepreneur.com/bestbanks) without making personal
guarantees--and for good reason. About half of all small businesses shut their
doors within five years of launching, and banks don't want to be left out to
dry. But there are creative ways to obtain unsecured loans and credit lines.
One option is to deal with non-bank lenders such as factors--financing
companies that provide asset-backed credit lines secured by a company's
receivables. Factors don't charge interest; instead, they buy your receivables
at a small discount, but you may end up paying more than you would if you got
a credit line from a bank, says Vasant Nanavati, CFO of marketing firm Active
Response Group. For businesses with $10 million or more in annual revenue,
solid growth and healthy cash flow, working with a mezzanine lender may be
another option. "It's a tough task to get a loan without a personal
guarantee," says Nanavati. "But there are possibilities out there for those
companies willing to put in the effort and pay the price."
