Choosing a Good Investment

Q: I just inherited $100,000. Should I use this money to start a business or
should I invest it? I'm looking for the best return on my money.

A: Well, as Harry Truman's two-handed economist might have said, "On the one
hand, you could start a business, but on the other hand..." So while I aspire
to give you a direct answer, there's more to this question than meets the eye
or, shall we say, pocketbook.

First, it takes more than money to start a successful business-a lot more.
Starting a business takes drive, commitment and an insatiable desire to work
like you've never worked before. When you're stuck in a job you don't like or
when you read about how Bill Gates started Microsoft in his garage, it may
seem like anyone can follow the yellow brick road to success. And while many
entrepreneurs _do_ make a go of their own business, undertaking this challenge
shouldn't be done lightly.

There are lots of ways to start a business. You may have an area of expertise
in which you could be a consultant, and that takes less money to start up than
a retail or food establishment, for example. Purchasing a franchise can cut
time and a number of potential mistakes from your learning curve, but these
can be expensive and hard to come by (see our [Franchise
500](/franchise500/index.html) listing for the top-rated franchises).

One of the best things you can do for yourself is to get a copy of _Start Your
Own Business_ (Entrepreneur Media Inc.). In it you'll find everything you need
to know to make your start-up a success. After reading it, you'll have a much
better idea about whether or not you should start a business.

On the other hand, if you're feeling tired just thinking about all the work
involved in starting your own business, investing money in the financial
markets can be a lot less time consuming, provided you're smart enough not to
fancy yourself a professional day trader. Here are some questions to ask
yourself before you make any investments:

  * What are my goals for this money? Consider both short-term (buying a new car or taking a vacation) and long-term (saving for a child's education or your retirement) goals.
  * Do I want or need income from this money now, or can I put it aside to let it grow?
  * How much risk can I withstand and still sleep comfortably at night?
  * What investment experience do I have? Will I need professional help or am I prepared to make financial decisions on my own?

These are just a few questions that should get you thinking. For more
information, consider my book, _Financial Fitness in 45 Days: The Complete
Guide to Shaping Up Your Personal Finances_ (Entrepreneur Press). In it you'll
find everything you need to know to get started on the road to financial
success.

Finally, whatever you decide, don't quit your day job just yet. While $100,000
is a lot of money, it's not quite a kiss to build a dream on.
