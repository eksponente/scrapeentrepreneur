Attract Investors by Sharing the Risk

**Q:** I have a great business idea, but no money to get started. A friend told me that since I came up the idea, I could find investors who will put up all the money. How can I raise the most money without giving away a large percentage of the company?

**A:** Just because you have an idea does not mean that investors are going to line up outside your door to throw money at you. Unless you have an idea that is truly astounding (those ideas are even more rare than friends with good advice), I can tell you from experience that you will have a very hard time finding a credible investor who is willing to write you a check. A savvy investor will not only expect you to have skin in the game, he will demand it.

What do I mean by "skin in the game?" Have you ever heard the phrase, "No skin
off my nose?" Perhaps you've heard a variation of the phrase with the skin
coming from the teeth or a different part of the body, but since this is a
family-oriented column, I will use your nose. What the phrase means is: I have
nothing to lose because I have no skin in the game. If you don't have skin in
the game, the chances of getting investors is pretty slim.

Having skin in the game means you are willing to make a significant investment
or financial commitment to your business venture. If you aren't willing to put
your own skin in the game--or put your own butt on the line, as I had an
investor so eloquently say to me once--why should anyone else be willing to
risk his or her money in your business idea?

Before you start trying to raise money, ask yourself how much money do you
really need and what will the money be used for. If you only need enough cash
to buy a delivery truck and a few supplies, that is a much easier task than
trying to raise money to build a factory and hire 100 workers. It is best to
raise more money than you think you will need, but don't try to raise $1
million to fund a hotdog stand.

Be prepared to give up a reasonable share of equity in exchange for the
investment made. When someone makes an investment in your business, he or she
will expect a fair amount of ownership in return. If you offer investors a
small amount of ownership in exchange for a large investment, you are not
going to raise much cash.

So, how do you go about funding a business if you have no cash on hand to
invest? There are a variety of ways to raise money, but be warned that
whenever you accept money from anyone, there are strings attached. If the
business fails, you may find yourself deep in debt and the relationship with
your investors strained.

Many experts recommend you raise seed money by asking friends and family to
invest. I've beaten this dead horse before: _Never_ accept money from anyone
you might have to sit next to at Thanksgiving dinner. Even if your friends and
family are begging you to take their money, think long and hard before
accepting. Sure, if the business succeeds and they all make back their
investment with interest, you are the hero of the family. But more often than
not, you will find yourself sitting next to someone whose life savings you
lost (that's right, the loss will be blamed on you personally, not on the
failure of the business), and he's not very happy about it. And he's holding a
rather large carving knife. And he keeps referring to you as "the turkey."

Some entrepreneurs turn to angel investors to help seed the business. Angel
investors are typically successful entrepreneurs or professionals with money
to invest in start-up ventures. Most angel investors, especially those that
built their own business from the ground up, know what it takes to start and
grow a business. They epitomize the phrase "been there, done that." Angel
investors are not only a good source of seed capital, but can also offer a
wealth of knowledge and guidance. Some of my greatest mentors have been angel
investors who took the time to share not only their money, but also their
experience and wisdom.

Be aware, however, that angel investors (especially those that are not true
entrepreneurs themselves) are not particularly fond of losing their money, so
get to know the investor before accepting his or her check. Do not insult
investors by asking for references from other entrepreneurs whom they have
invested in, but do a little quiet research on your own to make sure an
angel's goals and personality are a good fit with your own.
