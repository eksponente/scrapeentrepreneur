Checking Out Online Investment Advice

A recent Google search for "investment advice" produced more than 5 million
results. How do you sort through it all to find the right help?

Mark Hulbert has been researching investment newsletters and comparing claims
against actual investment performance for more than 25 years with his
independent newsletter, _The Hulbert Financial Digest_. His life, and yours,
has become more difficult in recent years. "The barriers to entry are so low
online," he says. "It used to be that people weren't [giving advice] as much
on a lark."

Hulbert is skeptical of sites and software packages that make aggressive
claims about their financial prowess while offering dozens of portfolio
suggestions. It's easy, he says, to look back over 200 portfolios you've
suggested to pick a few that did well. He looks even more askance at sites
that don't have a measurable history of portfolio predictions. At sites like
[www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org/), you can check what a particular
website was saying on a particular date, allowing you to see how reliable a
site is.

Ask people you trust for advice, and search online for sites that interest
you. Then, paper trade each of them for a few months, Hulbert advises. Create
a spreadsheet and mark trades that you might have made based on
recommendations at the sites in question. See how they do over time.
"Unfortunately, from a statistical point of view, you need years, not months,"
Hulbert says. But it gives you an idea of how each site works and how reliable
its predictions are in the short term. If you notice that a site's claims
change, check them against your reality. You can walk away with nothing lost
other than some of your time.
