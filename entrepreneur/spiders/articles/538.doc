Money Matters

How do you decide who handles your money? According to Jack Waymire, author of
_[Who's Watching Your Money? The 17 Paladin Principles for Selecting a
Financial Advisor](http://www.paladinregistry.com)_, 75 percent to 80 percent
of financial advisors are really sales reps masquerading as advisors. We
recently talked to the author to learn how entrepreneurs can choose wisely.

**_Entrepreneur_: What are the most common mistakes entrepreneurs make when looking for a financial advisor?**

**Waymire:** If you think about finding an advisor, two things generally happen: either you find the advisor, or the advisor finds you. And unfortunately, a lot of entrepreneurs are on [many advisors'] hit lists. [Bad advisors] tend to be more sales-oriented, and they're cold calling, marketing. One of the biggest mistakes [entrepreneurs] make is that they listen to these sales pitches . . . and they hire people that sound good as opposed to looking at the credentials and business practices of the advisor.

**What should you look for in a good financial advisor?**

**Waymire:** You want somebody who's college-educated with at least five years of experience--probably 10 years or more. You want somebody with one or more certifications: a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), [or another good certification] is a Certified Investment Management Analyst (CIMA). You want somebody with a lot of knowledge and a lot of integrity; check their compliance record at the National Association of Securities Dealers website ([www.nasd.org](http://www.nasd.org)) to make sure they're clean. That's the kind of person you want handling your assets.

**What are the red flags to look for in a bad financial advisor?**

**Waymire:** [Many are] only Series 6 licensed--which means they can only sell products for commissions, they can't offer advice for fees. You really want a fee-based advisor because one of the biggest criteria for avoiding that bad guy is [asking], How does he get paid? If they only want to sell you products for commissions, that's a huge red flag. Think about the way you compensate a lawyer, CPA or any other professional. I pay [them] an hourly rate; I don't pay a commission.
