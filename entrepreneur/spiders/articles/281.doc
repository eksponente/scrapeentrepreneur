What to Pay Yourself

There is no place where self-discipline plays a more important role than in
setting your own salary. As the owner and founder, you can allocate as much or
as little of the company's profits as you want to your own paycheck. You can
even decide to go further. You can tell your accountant to cut you a check
equal to the entire month's sales. That will be a high-water mark for your
earnings, however, since draining that much cash will ensure that it is your
last month in business.

There are two groups of interested parties in the decision about how much to
pay yourself. First, you have to do right by your partners (if any),
employees, suppliers, creditors and customers. If you take money out your
company for yourself to the extent that any of these parties are damaged, it
could be a mistake.

But you also have to consider yourself (and perhaps your spouse and your
children), as well as any charitable causes you support out of your earnings.
These interested parties deserve a fair cut of the bounty, too. You should get
a decent return on the labor and risk you have invested. Your family should,
of course, share in those benefits.

Complicating the issue is the fact that there is no set amount an entrepreneur
should earn. Strictly speaking, it's all yours, or as much of it as you retain
ownership of. Of course, a board of directors, partners, other owners and
lenders may also have a say in this. Absent all limits, in a world where only
you and your company are involved in the decision, you have to choose between
taking money out to spend on yourself and your interests outside work, or
reinvesting it in the company, where it can power further growth. The decision
to take or reinvest profits is a highly personal one that turns on the fulcrum
where your interests and those of your business coincide.

Other than taking a salary, there are several ways you can get value out of
your business. They are:

  * **Dividends.** You can elect to pay yourself any amount you want by declaring it a dividend.
  * **Paying family members.** You can hire family members and pay them just like regular employees (as long as they're working just like regular employees.) This at least keeps the money in the family.
  * **Fringe benefits.** You may be able to pay for country club memberships, company cars, luxury business trips to popular destinations, and give yourself other attractive perquisites-and have them treated as tax-deductible business expenses. Just make sure you offer them to other employees as well.
  * **Delayed compensation.** If you chose to forgo compensation during your start-up phase, when cash was critical, you can take larger compensation now without fear of being accused by the IRS of taking excessive compensation-as long as you carefully documented your delayed-compensation plan when you were carrying it out.
  * **Don't forget loans.** You may be able to take a loan from your business as long as you document it in writing, pay a market rate of interest, and have a definite schedule for repaying it. Without those features, a loan between a business and its owner may run afoul of the IRS.

One more note: Be careful about paying yourself a very high salary and
attempting to deduct it as a payroll expense. The IRS tends to view such
salaries as dividends, which could mean you can't deduct your compensation as
a business expense. Plus, you'd have to pay corporate taxes on the dividend.
