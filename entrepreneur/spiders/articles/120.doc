Content Is Boring, So FunnyBizz Was Born

"READ THIS SH*T." That was the subject line of the first email blast I sent to
the AlleyNYC email list more than two years ago. I got some people pissed off,
some emails that said I was being unprofessional, etc. More importantly,
though, what I really got was a 85 percent open rate. There's NOTHING
unprofessional about that.

People thought it was raw, engaging and funny so they opened it. Good content
marketing is essential for anyone trying to deliver a message. Whether they
are your prospects, clients or friends, nobody wants boring crap in their
lives. This idea seems simple, yet we are filled with useless and boring
content. Think of the last email you got. It probably sucked.

It is with this in mind that AlleyNYC has partnered with an amazing company
that is having a conference later this week in New York to teach anyone who is
interested how to make your content better. It's mostly for businesses and
it's funny -- hence the name, The FunnyBizz Conference.

I met up with the founders, Rachman Blake and David Nihill, to learn a bit
more about the conference so I can bring it to you.

**What is The FunnyBizz Conference?**

FunnyBizz is a one-day conference with a mission of helping rid the world of
boring content. It’s the the only event of its kind, where leading thinkers
from the seemingly disparate worlds of comedy and business converge to help
you pull your stick out of the mud using comedy, humor and creative
storytelling, and harness one of the most powerful tools available to mankind-
laughter.

_“People love a good story. We are wired to appreciate it. We also are wired
to love laughter. Our brains by releasing dopamine make it so. Combining humor
and story give content a natural endorphin-fuelled evolutionary advantage”
(David Nihill)_

**You did this event before, can you share any stories of successes?**

We had a lot of creative collaborations, many still in progress. One tech CEO
completely revamped her hiring policy to bring in people who could better
leverage humor in her companys content creation and messaging,

**Why did you start the conference?**

Companies we spoke to were really struggling to consistently create effective
content. Our belief, that underlies the structure of the conference, is that
the best way for companies to grab attention and create compelling, shareable
content is to start with a good story, use creative techniques to add humor
and deliver it in its most effective copy written form. We wanted bring a
group of experts together who could provide the tools, techniques and tales of
how they used humor in business to be more successful and stand out from all
the noise.

**When is the conference and how do people sign up?**

The conference is Thursday, October 30th, from 9am-5pm at the Galapagos Art
Space, 16 Main St, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201

**What's the future for the FunnyBizz Conference?**

There is a lot of boring content out there we would like to help rid the world
of. Our next event will be in San Francisco again early next year with a host
of new cities coming soon.
