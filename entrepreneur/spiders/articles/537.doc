The Right Fit

Brandon Cushman grew up around the construction business. And although he was
ready to graduate from medical school in 1999, it was the construction
business that lured him out of the hospital and back into the hot sun. Today,
Cushman's Denver-based company, [Fauxcrete Inc.](http://www.fauxcrete.com),
pours nearly $5 million worth of stamped and dyed concrete every year.

Denver's seemingly endless appetite for development fueled strong growth for
Fauxcrete. Cushman says he doubled his business annually between 1999 and
2004. But that rapid growth leveled off last year when his banks and investors
tightened the purse strings and left him scrambling for cash to buy needed
trucks and equipment, not to mention meet payroll. "Every bit of cash we got,
we put back into the company," says Cushman. "We needed capital to grow, and
we'd exhausted our ability to borrow."

####  Falling Into a Black Hole

At wit's end, Cushman decided he'd have to sell the company to someone who
could afford to fund its growth. But the company's $2.7 million price tag
created new problems. "When we put it up for sale, our consultants said we
were in a black hole. We were under the radar of private equity groups and
over the heads of private individuals," says Cushman. "We were stuck. I
couldn't get a loan to grow it, and I couldn't sell it."

If Fauxcrete had been spinning off $10 million a year in profits, financial
buyers would have lined up. There are literally hundreds of private equity
groups, or PEGs, that purchase companies that have reached significant
profitability. But Fauxcrete was too small for a traditional PEG, and
Cushman's offer to sell languished at the business brokerage for nearly an
entire year.

Enter [Silvercloud Companies](http://www.silvercloudcos.com) of Denver, a new
boutique private equity group and holding company founded by Chris Younger.
Silvercloud is a small fund by traditional standards--with about $10 million
total capital--but its size makes it the perfect funding partner for companies
like Fauxcrete that are stuck in the "black hole" between individuals and
traditional large investment funds.

####  If the PEG Fits . . .

Cushman says his deal with Silvercloud had benefits in many areas: The fund
has enough capital to pursue growth opportunities, the fund managers bring
years of corporate expertise to bear on his problems, and although Silvercloud
purchased a majority of the shares of the company, Cushman gets to keep his
job for as long as he wants it. Compared to selling outright or taking on
money from an absentee partner, Silvercloud offers the best of both worlds.

Those mixed capabilities make boutique equity funds incredibly valuable to
entrepreneurs. In the world of large, traditional PEGs (or even VC firms, for
that matter), it is rare to find fund managers who do more than attend monthly
board meetings.

Although historical data is scarce, the emergence of boutique PEGs seems to
have coincided with the vast personal wealth created during the internet boom.
And the fact that they manage personal wealth, rather than institutional
savings, is exactly what makes boutique PEGs different. Traditional PEGs
invest on behalf of insurance companies, pension funds and other institutional
investors, and therefore end up with a very disciplined approach to making
large investments. Boutique PEGs, on the other hand, can do just about
anything the individual investors want.

####  Boutique Shopping

Because they are largely a reflection of the individuals behind them, boutique
PEGs come in many flavors. Some, like EJB World Trade of Charlotte, North
Carolina, manage the investments of a single wealthy family or small group of
close-knit investors. Because the managers are free to invest in a variety of
opportunities, EJB defies easy definition. "We just don't know what to call
ourselves," says Brad House, EJB's president and managing partner.

EJB has made venturelike investments into very early stage companies as well
as PEG-like investments into growth-stage ventures. Plus, the three managing
partners take very active roles in management, often going so far as to hire
and train key staff.

In other cases, a boutique PEG may represent angel investors through what is
called a "pledge fund." One such pledge fund is [Compass Point of
Carmel](http://www.cpcpartners.com), California. Erik Bethel, partner at
Compass Point, is looking to invest from $1 million to $10 million in each of
two to four growing, consumer-branded companies.

"We help entrepreneurs in many different situations," says Bethel. "It could
be a management team that wants to buy the business, a founder who needs
growth capital, or an older entrepreneur who just wants out of the company
altogether." In any event, Compass Point has the right resources for companies
that are stuck below the threshold of larger, traditional finance groups.

Finally, some boutique PEGs look more like entrepreneurial companies
themselves. Mac Lackey started [Blackhawk
Equity](http://www.blackhawkequity.com) of Charlotte, North Carolina, after a
successful entrepreneurial career in the technology industry. Now, Lackey's
Blackhawk fund is majority partner in an early stage company making high-
quality khakis and active wear. Lackey expects to play an operating role in
three to five companies as he invests his fund companies in various industries
and at various stages of growth.

####  What to Expect

Like all equity investors, boutique PEGs have investment criteria and
expectations that can give an entrepreneur heartburn. Many, including those
highlighted above, expect to buy a controlling interest in a company. Giving
up control requires an entrepreneur to accept the investor as a boss, no
matter how much it hurts. And when control changes, the founder's job
description often changes, too. For business owners who love being in charge,
giving control to a new investor may not make sense.

On the other hand, when a fund buys control, some or all of the capital will
go to purchasing shares of stock from the founder. That means the founder
benefits personally from the transaction--a very different proposition than
most investors can offer.

Finding a small PEG can be tough, since most prefer to remain under the radar.
A web search may turn up a few, but the smallest don't even have websites.
Word-of-mouth--through networking with angel investors, VCs and larger PEGs--
is often the only way to learn about these boutiques.

Cushman of Fauxcrete says the transaction with Silvercloud couldn't have gone
better. Even though he gave up a majority interest in the company, he says the
net result was positive for both him and his company. "After getting to know
Younger and his management style and the opportunities that he brought," he
says, "it was a no-brainer."
