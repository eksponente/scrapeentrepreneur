3 Ways to Immerse Yourself in Startup Life

When I speak to recent grads of high school, undergrad or masters programs,
I'm often asked the exact same question: "Should I pursue my own business now
or work for a startup?"

I think the prevailing assumption is that entrepreneurs are autonomous to the
max -- to the degree that they would never work for anyone, ever. This type of
thinking prompts many recent grads to ask if entrepreneurship is really for
them since they feel like they might want to work for someone else first,
before they [start their own
enterprise](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/starting-a-business). They want
or need to test-drive the entrepreneurship proposition first.

So that perfectly brilliant people won't be turned off from pursuing their
dream or labor under the assumption that to be an entrepreneur, they must be
all or nothing, founder or employee, I sought the perspective of some
entrepreneurs, founders and staffers at startups.

LP Maurice, the CEO and co-founder of Montreal-based bus travel company
[Busbud](http://busbud.com/), tells me he thinks that first working at a
startup is helpful for those hoping for eventual new-business launches. Those
who come to know and understand the unique challenges and opportunities faced
by startups are much more likely to succeed in their own endeavours later, he
says.

Through his mentoring work, Maurice has seen firsthand the confidence gained
by would-be entrepreneurs and the  insights they unearth about previously
unidentified skills and gifts after placing themselves in a challenging
startup environment.

Toronto-based Satish Kanwar, director of product at
[Shopify](http://shopify.com/), an Ottawa company that offers software for
creating an online store, speaks of the opportunities found by those who
choose to work in a startup before taking the plunge themselves: “One of the
best things someone can do is date a company first to see if you like startups
and the entrepreneurial space before you commit to it,” he says.

Kanwar and Maurice are co-organizing Thursday's [Startup Open
House](http://startupopenhouse.com/), staged simultaneously in Montreal and
Toronto, with the aim of accelerating this kind of speed dating between
startups and students, young professionals and would-be entrepreneurs. More
than 3,500 participants will get a look behind the curtain at some 250
startups to see what entrepreneurial life is all about. Hicham Ratnani, COO of
Montreal-based men's clothing ecommerce startup [Frank &
Oak](http://www.frankandoak.com/), wrote me that the event is a great vehicle
for gathering up entrepreneurs “to discuss and share big wins and
opportunities."

This idea of dating before committing is good for both parties. It can also be
a great opportunity for startups to find the very best talent.

So if you're considering a career in entrepreneurship, opt for one of these
three ways to discover if life in the startup world should be your next big
step:

## 1\. Simply go ahead and start a company.

You could say just launch your startup, saying, Screw it. Let's do it! This is
also known as the blind date method.

## 2\. Work for a relative's or friend's business.

Perhaps Aunt Selma’s flower shop needs a front-counter person. Try out working
for a startup or small business. This is akin to being set up on a date.

## 3. Immerse yourself in the startup scene.

Try "speed dating" by checking out an open house event attended by
entrepreneurs or finding a co-working space and sitting in the coffee area to
chat up those nearby. Then figure out which company might be a good fit for
you in providing valuable experience. This approach to learning about startups
is akin to using dating app Tinder.

In the end, there is great value to finding where you fit in along the
entrepreneurship spectrum. So if you're wondering, just put yourself out
there. Go date a startup.
