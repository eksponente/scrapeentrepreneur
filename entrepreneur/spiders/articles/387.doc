Individual Retirement Accounts: 2006 Changes

On August 17, 2006, President Bush signed into law the Pension Protection Act
of 2006. Several of the act's provision directly impact Individual Retirement
Accounts (IRAs). Here are some of the significant changes:

**Income Tax Refunds**  
When you file your 2006 taxes, you now have the option to have your tax refund
directly deposited into your IRA. The new law is flexible and allows you to
allocate your refund in up to three accounts. So if your refund is larger than
what you'd planned to contribute to your IRA, you can redirect the excess into
your checking account. You should first determine how much you can contribute
and then figure out how to apply your refund.

**Non-Spouse Beneficiaries**  
Among the act's numerous provisions were several that specifically benefit
unmarried couples and married same-sex couples. First, a non-spouse
beneficiary (or a same-sex spouse, who is considered a "non spouse" for
Federal purposes) who inherits qualified plan assets, such as a 401(k) or a
403(b), can now roll over their interest into an IRA. This allows for the
continued tax deferral of all accumulation while mandatory distributions are
taken over their life expectancy. Previously, when a non-spouse inherited
assets from a qualified retirement plan, the non-spouse was forced to withdraw
most, if not all, assets immediately, triggering a large tax liability.

Second, the new law now allows 401(k) hardship withdrawals for hardships and
unforeseen financial emergencies with respect to any person who is listed as a
beneficiary under a 401(k) plan. This means that if a non-spouse is listed as
a beneficiary to a 401(k) plan, they can potentially withdraw money from the
401(k) plan when they experience an unexpected financial emergency.
Previously, this provision was only available for hardship expenses relating
to legally recognized spouses and dependents.

You should note that these provisions apply to all non-spouses who are named
beneficiaries of a retirement account, including siblings who name each other
and parents who name their children

**Qualified Charitable Deductions**  
The new law also offers certain taxpayers the ability to make charitable
contributions directly from their IRA without having to declare the
distribution as income. This strategy could potentially be more tax efficient
than the old way of taking the distribution, reporting the income and taking
the deduction on your taxes.

Of course, there are caveats. The following rules apply. First, the IRA owner
must be at least 70 plus years of age. Second, the maximum amount that can be
contributed is $100,000 per individual for both tax years 2006 and 2007.
Third, the contribution must be made directly by the IRA trustee to the
charitable organization. Lastly, the contributions must come from IRAs and do
not apply to SEPs or SIMPLE IRAs.

This could be a wonderful planning opportunity if you are charitably inclined,
since you can use a qualified charitable distribution to satisfy the IRA
owner's required minimum distributions.

As with all tax and financial planning advice, you should consult with your
own advisor for the specifics that apply to your unique situation.
