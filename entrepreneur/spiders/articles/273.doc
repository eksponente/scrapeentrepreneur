Short-Term Loan Solutions

Can a business borrow some money for the short-term to help cover expenses
while building revenues? Yes, and the way to do this type of deal is to secure
three or four investors to lend your business funds as part of an overall one-
year to 18-month plan. The big picture is that this format is really a series
of short-term loans perfectly sequenced to fit end to end. There are many
companies who have used this successfully to keep cash flow flowing while they
build and implement the firm's sales and marketing plan. The first four or
five monthly payments can actually be made from the proceeds of the loan,
provided there is a successor loan set to kick in on the back-end of each
credit extension. And owners should understand that each successive round of
funding should be an increased level compared to the prior level. There are
significant risks involved in pursuing this kind of a deal, but there are also
some very attractive potential benefits that buy your company some time to get
established in the market.

Here's how it can work. A company sets up a three-month line of credit for,
say, $35,000 (must be repaid in full in 90 days). The annual equivalent
interest at 7 percent is around $2,400, so it costs about $200 per month
"interest-only" for the first three months the $35,000 is accessed. The
company sets aside $5,000 to make a 90-day principal payment that could
trigger a 30- or 60-day extension of the original terms. This serves as a
fallback position in case the subsequent second loan is not ready for some
reason on the 91st day. The company can now use more than $29,000 for
operations over the next 90 days, and even without revenue, it can make the
$200 interest-only payments each month and have $5,000 set aside to make a
principal reduction payment in case they need to keep this line open for
another one to two months.

At the 91st day, a second lender steps in with perhaps a $50,000 working
capital credit line for another 120 days. This loan is fully amortized over
the four months and requires monthly payments of $12,682 (principal and
interest) to stay in good standing. The first month's payment is held in a
money market account for that initial payment due in 30 days. Now the company
has use of around $25,000 (half the loan) for 60 days until payment number two
is due, and another $12,000 for the following 30 days out to the end of the
third month. By then, the firm will have secured a few early sales on its
marketing plan, and a few of these will have already been collected and can be
used to pay for some operations items.

New sales are then stockpiled toward the final $12,682 payment that fully
retires the loan, and the third short-term loan is then set to begin. This
time, the company now has two positive credit ratings on its record and
qualifies with another line for $100,000 and a one-year term, and perhaps the
loan is now structured as interest-only on a quarterly basis. That requires
payments of only around $600 per month, and the firm could hold back one-third
($33,000) of these funds to make a "good faith" principal payment in the fifth
or sixth month. This demonstrates to the lender that the company can handle
its debt service and principal, and it helps build a very favorable credit
rating for the firm.

There are risks, of course. If the firm does not generate sales and any loan
cannot be extended, and all the loan proceeds have already been spent, then
the lender will foreclose on the principal and the owner(s) could be
personally liable for repayment, or assets pledged as collateral could be
seized to repay the principal. But these risks are manageable if the owners
don't use all the funds at each access point and reserve a portion of the
principal for monthly debt service and/or a "good faith" early principal
portion repayment.
