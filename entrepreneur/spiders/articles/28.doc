It's All About #LameOfficeHolidays

Another day, another made-up holiday.

As we close out a week that saw both [Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work
Day](http://www.daughtersandsonstowork.org/wmspage7d10.html?parm1=936) and
[Administrative Professionals Day](http://www.iaap-hq.org/events/apw) there’s
some fun being had on [Twitter](http://twitter.com) with the social campaign #
[LameOfficeHolidays](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LameOfficeHolidays&src=tr
en).

The hashtag was concocted on Chris Hardwick’s Comedy Central show,
[@midnight](http://www.cc.com/shows/-midnight). In a segment called [Hashtag
Wars](http://instagram.com/p/nMqBgnN6gU/), three comedians throw out their
best ideas for a hashtag campaign and viewers are then encouraged to play
along on [Twitter](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/twitter).

Some of the ideas circulating include “Be Kind to Microsoft Clippy Day,” “Help
Yourself to Anyone's Lunch in the Fridge Day” and “National Stapler Safety
Awareness Day.”

What holidays would you start? Has your company or office implemented a fun
(or lame) holiday? Let us know in the comments.
