Bury The Seven-Day Workweek

We all know small-business owners who work seven days a week-maybe you're even
one of them. Others of you may not believe such workaholics actually exist.
Let us assure you, they do. They're in every neighborhood of every city; some
of your own friends may be closet workaholics. Well, we're here to tell you
there's hope for this most unfortunate affliction. And affliction it is,
because it's one of the single greatest impediments to business growth. So
let's talk about your friends and ours.

We usually meet two types of workaholics. Some work regular hours and take
tons of work home with them, working late into the night. These are the closet
workaholics-their neighbors see them come and go at regular hours, and have no
idea that when everyone else is watching Leno or Lettermen, these people are
busy with the business problems they've taken home. The second type of
workaholic isn't ashamed of the long hours he or she works and doesn't hide
anything from neighbors, friends or family. This type of business owner works
every day of the week, breaking only when the family threatens to disown them.

As different as these two types may seem to most observers, the same forces
cause their behavior. Some find their businesses marginally profitable and
declare an inability to hire the required assistants. Others lack confidence
in their own ability to train others who could actually relieve their work
burden. Some have had a revolving door of assistants and have grown weary of
training new people. And, of course, we've all met the perfectionist-only he
or she can do the work well enough.

Fortunately there's a very practical solution to the current problem, one we
learned while in the U.S. Marine Corps. It's all about baby steps. Let us
explain. During a new Marines' initial training at boot camp, he or she is
given greater and more challenging opportunities to learn and practice
leadership skills. The first leadership learning opportunity may merely
involve leading one other Marine in raking sand. The next, more challenging
opportunity may be leading three other Marines in marching drills. At the end
of boot camp, with progressively more difficult leadership challenges met, a
more confident person has emerged. While it's probably impractical to get the
workaholic to work less, cold turkey, this same building-block principle can
be applied to overcoming unhealthy work habits.

Let's tackle the marginally profitable business first. The business may be
small and still employ several people, but the owner just can't see his or her
way clear to hire someone to relieve his or her own work burden. The solution
is to look at the small picture instead of the big picture. Perhaps you can't
hire a full-time office manager, but you can afford to hire someone to work a
very limited schedule to open the mail, sort the bills and run the inevitable
errands that arise. The key is to start this person off with only a few
specific duties and be flexible with this employee's schedule. As the
financial health of your business increases, you can begin to think about a
larger staff or more hours for this part-time person.

For the workaholics with nonfinancial excuses for extreme work schedules, you,
too, must take it one step at a time. Understand that for your business to
grow beyond what you alone can handle, you must be able to delegate many tasks
you now handle yourself. You must overcome your fears and bring new people in
to share your work burden. And, as the new employees are taking away some of
the load, you must begin to work less yourself. But again, you don't have to
do it all at once. Just getting in the habit of taking a few extra hours off
will help you gain confidence in your staff and eventually make it easier to
work less yourself.

And, of course, you must not use the lighter workload to find more work for
yourself. You must take the new free time to have a little fun and enjoy the
lifestyle you've worked so hard to create.
