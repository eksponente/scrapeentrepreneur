Earn Customer Trust and the Rest Will Follow

When starting a business, there are many decisions to be made and factors to
consider to ensure success. From who to hire and where to locate a
headquarters to how to secure business partners and investors, these can all
have both immediate and long-term effects on a startup. That said, one element
that is a key for all new companies to establish from day one is customer
trust – especially newly founded companies.

Let’s face it, startups don’t have a track record, name recognition or
credibility. Why should customers trust them? Yet they do, every day. For a
company that is working to get off the ground, what is the best way to
accomplish this and establish legitimacy? It can be tricky.

As an entrepreneur in the finance-tech space, I have had to address this issue
many times over, as clients are often abandoning traditional payment methods
and turning to new, innovative products and services to move their money
globally.

Over time, I’ve found three effective ways for building trust with customers
from the start.

## **Incorporating trust into your business model. **

Having a transparent business model that allows early adopters to provide
feedback and input shows that your company is not only listening to those
outside of the organization but also able to adjust to meet the expectations
and needs of its customers.

At my current company, Currency Cloud, we systematically surveyed our
customers to find how we could best serve them and fill a void in the market
by actually providing services that companies need. We focused on identifying
how clients were utilizing our platform, which features they found the most
useful and how we could improve. This survey in reality was simple to create
and administer, but at the same time, provided us with a wealth of knowledge
that we could use to continue to strengthen our services.

## **Having the right investors and board.**

Not only should your investors and board trust you but your customers and
business partners should also have confidence in your backers. Having the
right names supporting your business shows your abilities as a leader to draw
in well-respected investors and industry leaders to advise and fund your
startup. This trusted roster of individuals and funders immediately shows
current clients and potential employees that they are in capable hands and can
be the tipping point for potential customers who are weighing their options
for working with a new company.

Attracting well-respected investors, advisors and board members requires the
same efforts and transparency needed to reach early stage customers.  Creating
an open and trusted foundation that draws in these individuals is an integral
part of achieving legitimacy.

## **Hiring employees with industry knowledge.**

Hiring employees that are knowledgeable and passionate about your industry and
mission is crucial for being a trusted brand.  When starting a company in a
relatively new industry, this can be a challenge, but taking the time to
surround yourself with individuals that you believe in shows investors and
customers your belief in the business. These are the people that are going to
represent you at new business pitches, meetings with partners and maintain
relationships with customers. Also, hiring individuals with industry
connections and great reputations can take some of the pressure off of
bringing in new clients and partners.

Many of our early deals at Currency Cloud were from referrals by people that
had previously worked with our executive team. Through this we quickly had the
confidence and customer base we needed to pursue other clients and grow our
company in the new FinTech industry.

All of these practices show customers that you are serious about earning and
keeping their trust. Once a strong relationship has been built with early
customers, investors, employees and business partners trust your efforts as a
leader and entrepreneur.
