Private-Label Credit Cards

There's nothing that gets Jackie Hoegger's juices flowing faster than trying
to find new ways to improve Vive Paris, the upscale women's boutique she
founded in Witchita Falls, Texas, several years ago. So after extensive
research, Hoegger decided one way to differentiate her two-store company from
competitors was to offer the Vive Paris credit card. "The credit card is
another way to get our name out there and keep us on the cutting edge,"
explains Hoegger. "We designed our own card because I wanted it to reek of
femininity and beauty. When [our customer] opens up her wallet, I wanted her
to say, 'Oh my gosh, what a pretty card.'"

With annual revenues of $1 million and a business pulling in customers from up
to 100 miles away, Hoegger is a prime candidate for a private-label credit
card, according to Stewart Armstrong of CrediCard National Bank, a San
Antonio-based limited-purpose bank that only finances private-label cards and
that set up the program for Vive Paris. "Our ideal client is an owner who
wants to integrate a private-label card into how they sell and service their
customers--an owner who knows their customers well and is trying to get repeat
business from a core group."

Finding a credit card financing company like CrediCard requires some digging,
because the number of firms offering private-label cards to start-up and
entrepreneurial firms has shrunk considerably as the finance industry has
consolidated. But they do exist: there's [CDS
Group/Myreceivables.com](http://www.myreceivables.com/), [Bank of
Louisiana](http://www.bankoflouisiana.com/) and [TD Retail Card
Services](http://www.shopperscharge.com/), to name a few.

And once you find potential underwriters, there's a laundry list of other
considerations: meeting minimum charge volumes, determining start-up and
ongoing costs, and deciding whether you want a company that specializes in
your industry. "[Such companies] understand the seasonality and nuances of the
businesses you're serving," says Edward Fechner, Senior Vice President of
sales and new business at TD Retail Card Services in Mahwah, New Jersey.

You'll also need to determine how much money and effort you'll put into
marketing the card. Leonard Leff of CDS Group suggests a company initially
invest at least $500 a month to advertise the new credit card.

All the underwriters we talked to for this piece want entrepreneurs to
proactively solicit potential card holders, but remember, this is a credit
application, and having the customer demographics to attract financiers is
critical. If your customers are young and/or have a skimpy credit history,
they may not be approved, unless you're willing to assume part of the risk.
Says Fechner, "You could create a lot of ill will for [yourself] if you have
to say no to better than 50 percent of your customers."

Once you evaluate your business and find an appropriate underwriter, the
benefits of a private-label card are many, says Robert Buss, vice president of
credit cards at Bank of Louisiana. "Your customers will have a relationship
with you that they'll have with no other merchant," he says. "With in-house
cards, you can reach your customers directly. You can't do that with Visa or
MasterCard. If you want to run a sale on shoes, for example, you can mail an
insert with the statement."

You can also advertise the benefits of your card to card users, such as
deferred billing, frequent-buyer programs, skip-a-payment programs or any
other promotional ideas you implement. And Hoegger discovered another bottom-
line benefit: "It took away my receivables," she says. "The credit card cut
them by about 50 percent, which means we can pay our invoices faster."

As with any business decision, you'll need to weigh the pros and cons of
establishing an in-house credit card. In the end, what matters most is whether
the card will push your bottom line further into the black.
