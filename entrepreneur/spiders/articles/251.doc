Commercial Break

By the mid-1990s, [Princeton Laundry](http://www.princetonlaundry.com) had
fallen on hard times. Despite a healthy client roster-it catered to New York
City hotels-the rising costs of operating in Manhattan had taken a toll. A
steep mortgage and mounting maintenance expenses for its commercial co-op
space made it exceedingly difficult to sustain the operation. To make matters
worse, the commercial laundry, owned by the Garlasco family for three
generations, was behind on its taxes.

"Our accountant kept telling us, 'Your business is profitable, but where
you're located [is] driving you out of business,'" recalls Kevin Garlasco, 40,
the company's treasurer and managing partner. Heeding the warning, the family
moved the company in a dramatic new direction-a 20-minute drive north to the
Bronx, where community leaders were dangling business incentives for economic
growth. There, the Garlascos built a new production facility that opened in
1997.

Leaving Manhattan was only a temporary solution, though. Even after Kevin, his
father, Larry, and brothers John and Michael mortgaged their homes for
funding, the family still needed a large infusion of working capital to
stabilize the company. Unfortunately, traditional creditors were wary of
recent financial hiccups, though the business had been around since 1918. "We
tried going to banks," says Kevin, "and it was always the same thing: They
wouldn't give us a loan because we were in a tight situation and a little
behind in paying our taxes. We were falling into a hole."

The answer to their financial woes was a commercial finance company, [Business
Alliance Capital](http://www.baccorp.com), in Princeton, New Jersey. Business
Alliance provided a $600,000 revolving line of credit secured by accounts
receivable. "We laid everything out on the table with them, and it wasn't a
pretty situation at that time," Kevin remembers. "It's gotten drastically
better. We were able to clear up our taxes, and now we're running our business
much more efficiently." Indeed, the family firm has grown approximately 30
percent to annual sales of $7 million since the 1998 funding intervention,
which also included about $500,000 in equipment financing.

####  A Different Breed

While Business Alliance Capital obviously saw growth potential, it didn't
place blind faith in the struggling business. Finance companies are simply a
different breed of lender than more mainstream creditors, such as banks.
Nonbank lenders like Business Alliance Capital advance funds based on a
percentage of a firm's assets- usually 25 to 60 percent for inventory and 75
to 85 percent for accounts receivable-and when that firm's receivables are
paid, the cash is turned over to the lender to pay down the loan. Because the
loans are secured by assets, finance companies can lend to businesses with
irregular cash flow, even losses-the very borrowers banks try to avoid. Banks
are principally cash-flow lenders, leaving many highly leveraged companies and
those with sporadic growth outside their financing domain.

Although there was a time when only troubled companies resorted to asset-based
funding, it's an increasingly common financing strategy for businesses with
fluctuating capital needs. "It's what we call the David and Goliath effect,"
explains Mike Parrish, regional manager for [The Commercial Finance
Group](http://www.cfgroup.net) in Atlanta. "You have a guy who's a hammer
manufacturer providing product to The Home Depot or Lowe's, but the problem is
that neither Lowe's nor The Home Depot is going to pay them in the 35 days
that a traditional company like that would get paid."

Part of the appeal of asset-based lenders is their willingness to give space
to borrowers going through a rough patch. Banks routinely impose financial
covenants on borrowers to monitor operating perform-ance, dictating such
things as minimum-working-capital balances and debt-to-equity ratios.
Depending on the extent of the covenants, a business may be just one financial
misstep away from losing critical funding. Finance companies, in contrast,
rarely use the kinds of restrictive covenants that accompany cash-flow loans,
instead touting themselves as a stable financing source even if a company's
circumstances take a negative turn. Ted Kompa, president and CEO of Business
Alliance Capital, says, "The company, from a standpoint of calling a loan for
financial performance, would have to be in pretty dire straits for a properly
secured finance company to want to take action."

####  The Cost of Convenience

The simplicity, however, comes at a price. While competition has helped drive
down the cost of asset-based credit, small loans may run 15 to 28 percent.
Both risk- and collateral-monitoring requirements figure heavily in the total
asset-based funding cost. For instance, a business that generates a large
volume of small invoices typically pays a monthly collateral-monitoring fee
ranging from one-quarter to one-half percent. On top of those fees, prepayment
penalties are standard to deter borrowers from refinancing with a bank if
creditworthiness improves.

It's quite common for businesses to get a bank loan once their financial
situation progresses. Princeton Laundry isn't one of them, however, despite
now having more secure financial footing. Kevin Garlasco says the higher costs
are a small price to pay for peace of mind during periods of market
volatility, such as the months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which
dealt a severe blow to the commercial laundry's core constituency: New York
City hotels. "Sales did slow down, but we got through it. If I were with a
bank," he says, "they probably would have been breathing down my neck."

Along with higher fees, finance companies have more arduous reporting
requirements. Lenders may require daily reports on sales and collections to
establish how much funding a business can draw against assets; in determining
borrowing capacity, lenders subtract ineligible assets, such as past-due
receivables. On a positive note, the rigorous reporting forces owners to
examine key aspects of their operations. "They may see receivables getting
old, but maybe they haven't looked to see why," says business advisor Debra
Pauli, president of [Corporate Financial
Solutions](http://www.corpfinsolve.com) in Atlanta. "This lending program
forces entrepreneurs to understand intimate details of their businesses. A
business is asset management from cash flow, and that's what this lending
program is all about."

The lesson isn't lost on Kevin Garlasco, who knows he has to actively manage
receivables to keep the funds flowing. "Anything over 90 days, that money is
not available to borrow," he says. "So I really have to keep control of my
customers and keep them paying."

MEET YOUR MATCH

While asset-based lenders are abundant, loan size ultimately determines an
entrepreneur's range of financing options.

For modest financing deals, borrowers may have to look harder for an asset-
based lender that focuses on smaller transactions. "Many specialize in [loans]
under $1 million, but they're not national in scope," says Ted Kompa,
president and CEO of Business Alliance Capital in Princeton, New Jersey. "You
have to look at each individual region to see who is active in that area." He
recommends contacting the Commercial Finance Association, a New York City-
based trade group for asset-based lenders, for a list of finance companies in
your area. You can search for lenders by geographic region and loan size at
the association's Web site, [www.cfa.com](http://www.cfa.com).

Before signing on with any finance company, though, carefully investigate its
track record. "Do some due diligence on that lender. Ask for references, and
talk to current customers to get a feel for what that customer [thought] they
were getting when they went in versus what they actually have now," advises
Debra Pauli, president of Corporate Financial Solutions in Atlanta. "You have
to remember that this is a competitive marketplace. Interview a lot of lenders
in your market."
