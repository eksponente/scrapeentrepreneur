Free Stock Trades for All

Online brokerages, such as Ameritrade and E-Trade, were born in the '90s as
innovative upstarts, offering low-cost alternatives to traditional brokerage
houses. They took great delight in--and made headlines across the financial
press for--charging a fraction of what old-school brokerages had been
siphoning from us in sales commissions. Now, just a few years later, the
prices are heading even lower.

Last fall, upstart [Zecco.com](http://www.zecco.com/) launched the first
attack in what's likely to be an online brokerage price war, offering free
basic stock trades for anyone with at least $2,500 in their accounts. Within
days, Bank of America responded with an offer of free brokerage trades for
customers who keep at least $25,000 in a checking, savings or money market
account, or in a CD. The plan was initially offered in the Northeast but has
since expanded. The TD Ameritrades, E-Trades and Charles Schwabs of the world
suddenly find themselves having to justify to customers why they should pay $5
or $10 per trade for services others are providing free.

Free stock trading has been tried in the past--generally with poor results--
but Zecco might be onto something. Free, after all, is the lingua franca of
the internet world. It would not be surprising to see a situation develop
where there are two types of brokerages: high-end, traditional shops where you
pay for advice, hand-holding and personal attention, and those where you pay
nothing for no-frills service.

Zecco's site features blog entries, a forum section and polls along with the
basic brokerage services. It's too soon to know how the site will fare, but
its approach seems smart. Other online brokerages may be compelled to follow
Zecco's lead sooner rather than later.

Meanwhile, Bank of America hopes to use free trading to convince customers to
sign up for mortgages, checking accounts and other bank services. Don't be
surprised if Citi, Wells Fargo and other bank-affiliated brokerages follow its
lead. And while the cost savings might not be enough to persuade you to switch
to Bank of America, if you're already a customer, take the free trades and
run.

In any case, commission-free trading is a friend of the investing public. Look
for more opportunities in coming months.
