Going Public

With the IPO window only beginning to open, entrepreneurs could be forgiven
for giving reverse mergers more than fleeting consideration. This "back door"
to the public market- reviled in the '70s and '80s for the shady deals it
spawned- private companies to become public by acquiring or merging with a
public "shell" company. The shell is listed on an exchange, usually the OTC
Bulletin Board, but has no assets, typically following a sale or bankruptcy. A
slew of regulations from the SEC in the early '90s made reverse mergers safer,
both for entrepreneurs and for investors, but many experts remain skeptical.

For business owners desperate to take their companies public, reverse mergers
are in fact a cheaper, quicker alternative to an IPO. They're also more
certain, says David Feldman, managing partner of law firm [Feldman Weinstein
LLP](http://www.feldmanweinstein.com) in New York City, who believes they no
longer warrant their bad rap. "You can work on an IPO for 12 months, and then
market conditions say 'We're not doing it,'" he says. Unlike a traditional
IPO, a reverse merger doesn't depend on market conditions, so it happens on
schedule, come bull or bear.

But on the downside, because the company isn't escorted onto the trading floor
on the arm of a powerful brokerage company or investment bank, market support
and analyst coverage are basically nil. "Pretty much nobody cares," concedes
Feldman. "Support develops over time." The reverse merger, he adds, is not
about raising tons of capital, although it does offer more liquidity for
investors. Rather, it's best for those companies for which being public would
be a significant asset, a strategic advantage.

That was so for [Immediatek Inc.](http://www.immediatek.com), a Richardson,
Texas-based technology solutions provider that makes burn and copyright
protection software. CEO Zach Bair says the technology is in high demand,
given the music industry's piracy headaches. But as a private company, Bair
couldn't get the time of day from either potential customers or investors.
"Without being public, I wouldn't have been able to make the contacts I have
with Sony, Warner and other record labels," says Bair, 40. He adds that the
potential for liquidity made Immediatek more attractive to investors.

But critics say that in a down market, liquidity is still just a wish for OTC
stocks. "Without the affiliation or certification of a traditional investment
banking firm, it's hard to convince legitimate investors there's not something
to be wary about," says [Jay Ritter](http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter), Cordell
professor of finance at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Without Wall
Street support, the company's stock can languish in obscurity, no better off
than when it was private.

Bair is counting on a few deals with big labels to give the company, with $1.5
million projected 2003 sales, the boost it needs to move from OTC to one of
the bigger exchanges. "We have the technology and the road map that will make
us a major player in this industry," he says.

According to Elizabeth Saunders, chair and co-founder of investor relations
advisory firm [Ashton Partners](http://www.ashtonpartners.com) in Chicago, too
many entrepreneurs hope OTC will be a springboard to Nasdaq, but very few
actually make it. "Most end up as OTC Bulletin Board stocks-a really tough
place to be," she says. "It's not as if financing comes easier than if you're
private. And you have a slew of reporting requirements."

The onerous requirements that come along with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have
placed a heavy burden on smaller companies and may make going public less
attractive than it once was, even via the relatively inexpensive reverse
merger. Bair says he doesn't regret doing it, but adds that he learned a lot
of lessons the hard way. "It's not about making a quick buck. But if you stay
focused on your business, and the product is compelling, and you have an
excellent management team, you have the chance to make it work."
