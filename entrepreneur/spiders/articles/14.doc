Another Hashtag Hijack: NYPD's Twitter Campaign Backfires

Trending on [Twitter](http://twitter.com) isn’t always a good thing.

The New York Police Department found that out the hard way when it invited its
followers to post photos of themselves with the boys in blue and hashtag it
#myNYPD.

Some posted pleasant, smiling photos. Others, not so much. (You know know
where this is going.)

Photos of police brutality took over the hashtag. Some had creative captions,
and some photos were disturbing.

Despite the hashtag hijacking, the NYPD is holding its head high.

NYPD spokesperson Deputy Chief Kim Y. Royster told the _[The New York
Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/nyregion/new-york-police-reach-out-
on-twitter-but-receive-a-slap-in-the-face.html?hpw&rref=nyregion&_r=1) that
the department was "creating new ways to communicate effectively with the
community" and that Twitter provided "an open forum for an uncensored
exchange" that is "good for our city."

The NYPD's hashtag snafu is only the latest incident of its kind. This past
November, JPMorgan Chase introduced a #AskJPM hashtag for a live chat that
[quickly turned into a peg for harsh criticism and led the bank to cancel the
chat altogether](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229939). In perhaps a
more memorable incident, McDonald’s rolled out an #McDStories campaign in
early 2012 that was supposed to inspire customers to share positive stories
about their experiences at the fast-food chain, but instead inspired stories
about food poisoning and vomiting.
