4 Steps to Navigate the Rough Waters of Information Overload

The entrepreneurial realm offers an ocean of opportunity. As a founder, you
have the chance to imagine, create, innovate and (hopefully) monetize a new
product or service never seen before.

However, with such opportunity also comes a propensity for confusion --
especially as the amount of information increases. To navigate the rough
waters of information overload, here are four steps to ensure your know-how
stays on track -- and accurate:

## 1\. State your objective.

In large meetings, I like to write the objective on a white board for everyone
to see. That way, when conversations go askew you can easily pose the
question, “Is this [current topic] in line with our objective?” and then
direct focus back to the task at hand. In other words, if you know the
destination it makes navigation much easier.

## 2\. Determine relevance.

Critical to building perspectives is questioning whether that information is
even needed. It’s easy to fall into the trap of “more information means more
power,” where “power” is defined as influence and decision-making rights. Not
so. There’s a fine line between information _over_load and “_under_load.”
Knowing when to say "when" is easy with a stated objective, but you still must
…

## 3\. Corroborate the source.

In the military, relying on single-source humint (human intelligence) is about
as trustworthy as a plane making a transatlantic flight on a single propeller
-- it may work, but it wouldn’t give me a “warm and fuzzy.” Instead,
corroborate your information from at least two different sources. Stay up to
date with current trends and news events in your industry by reading industry
publications, blogs or joining social groups. Here are a few places to start:

  * [Entrepreneurs’ Organization](http://www.eonetwork.org/): This entrepreneurial goldmine offers shared insights from other startup leaders and peers to build your information repertoire.
  * [Vistage](http://www.vistage.com/): Otherwise known (by me) as an entrepreneurial melting pot. Vistage brings together divergent industry leaders to cross-pollinate their lessons learned and best practices and [share knowledge rather than hoard it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141017135802-62555028-why-knowledge-is-not-power?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_LIKE).
  * [Tech Cocktail](http://tech.co/) is a way to socialize startup communities and serve as a reliable source for entrepreneurs to “to get informed, get connected and get inspired,” according to its website. It also offers industry trends and instructional how-to’s to build your startup smarts.

## 4\. Test it.

Once your information is corroborated, it’s time for the most challenging
part, which is putting theory into practice.

Stephen Bungay, in his book _[The Art of Action: How Leaders Close the Gaps
between Plans, Actions, and Results](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/18578855
97/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=185
7885597&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjeffbossco-20&linkId=UKJ7U7ULQ4OE2BTO)_, referred
to a five-year-long survey that included 125,000 managers from more than 1,000
companies in more than 50 countries. Notably, the survey mentioned how
“employees in three out of five companies rated their organization ‘weak’ at
execution.”

While the reasons why execution is lacking differs for everybody, one common
trepidation is the uncertainty in customer demand. Here are a few sources to
help test and validate existing information:

  * [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/): Here you can search the traffic for specific keywords over a period of years.
  * [Keyword Tool](http://keywordtool.io/): This is a free tool where you can test keyword popularity.
  * [Usertesting](http://www.usertesting.com/): This website lets you crowdsource the market demand for an idea and get immediate feedback based on appeal and usability.

At the end of the day, there are myriad reasons for why startups fail, but
having the right information shouldn't be one of them. Do your due diligence
and build your entrepreneurial smarts every day.
