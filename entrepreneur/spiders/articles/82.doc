BlackBerry Takeover Bid Falls Apart, CEO to Depart

The $4.7 billion deal that would have taken
[BlackBerry](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/blackberry) Ltd. private has
come undone. The Waterloo, Canada-based tech company announced today that
Fairfax Financial Holdings, the investment firm that proposed the [takeover
bid](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/buyouts) but was unable to raise the
necessary funds, will instead invest $1 billion in BlackBerry.

What's more, BlackBerry says its chief executive, Thorsten Heins, [will be
leaving the company](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackberry-receives-
investment-of-us-1-billion-from-fairfax-financial-and-other-institutional-
investors-2013-11-04-81733131?reflink=MW_news_stmp). David Kerr, a managing
partner at investment holding company Edper Financial Corporation, will step
down from BlackBerry's board of directors -- a role he held since July 2007.
Heins was appointed president and chief executive in January 2012.

As part of the new agreement, Fairfax and other investors will invest $1
billion in "convertible debentures" in BlackBerry, with Fairfax contributing
$250 million. A convertible debenture is a type of loan that can be converted
into common stock if BlackBerry's stock price hits $10 a share.

Upon the closing of the transaction, John Chen, the former chairman and chief
executive of Sybase, is expected to serve as interim chief executive and board
chairman until the company finds a replacement. Prem Watsa, Fairfax's chairman
and chief executive, will be appointed lead director and chair of BlackBerry's
Compensation, Nomination and Governance Committee.

The agreement is expected to be reached in the next two weeks, pending
approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Despite its sudden change of course and failure to go private after months of
searching for a buyer, BlackBerry touted today's news as a "significant vote
of confidence."

"This financing provides an immediate cash injection on terms favorable to
BlackBerry, enhancing our substantial cash position," board chair Barbara
Stymiest said. "Some of the most important customers in the world rely on
BlackBerry and we are implementing the changes necessary to strengthen the
company and ensure we remain a strong and innovative partner for their needs."

But investors apparently are less confident. BlackBerry shares are trading at
$6.88, down more than 11 percent.
