Pros and Cons of Incubator Funding

Prior to launch, new businesses have to hire people; register the business
name; formally organize the company as an Sub-S corporation, C corporation,
limited partnership or LLC; and get banking services in place. Entrepreneurs
also have to set up:

  * Office space for managers and staff.
  * Lobby and reception space.
  * Meeting and conference space (white board, projector-screen capability).
  * Communications infrastructure (phones, fax, internet).
  * Computing capabilities (PCs, networks).
  * Website hosting.
  * Postal and overnight delivery addresses.
  * Document processing.

And, most importantly, the venture has to get funded. For most startups,
getting everything in place is a major headache. But for many emerging
companies, launching at an incubator might be the one-stop solution to all the
tasks outlined above.

Incubators are essentially ready-to-go space and support infrastructure for
startup companies. They also may have a full-time incubator support staff to
help you and your personnel with finance, marketing, sales, IT, strategy and
other areas of operations. Under one roof, entrepreneurs can have turnkey
access to professional reception and waiting area, mailboxes, parcel pickup,
office space, meeting and conference rooms, and access to all the hardware and
gadgets needed to conduct daily business.

Remember, a business incubator is itself an entrepreneurial venture, as
investors have pooled their funds to secure a large building and outfit the
space with its own support team and everything needed for dozens of startups
to engage in business. The incubator generates revenue by charging monthly
rental-access fees to the tenant companies.

But many incubators also have investment capital as part of their overall
buffet of goods and services for entrepreneurs, taking an equity and/or debt
position in incubator companies, thereby creating a portfolio of investment
positions that provide some significant upside potential to the incubator's
investors.

Having provided consulting services to more than 125 entrepreneurial growth
companies since 1984, I'm very well acquainted with a wide range of incubator
types and sizes used by more than a dozen of my clients. I also have hands-on
knowledge from the insider's perspective, as a founding member of the Advisory
Board for the [Santa Barbara Technology Incubator
(SBTi)](http://www.sbti.com/), which opened in late 1999. And I'm an incubator
alum who launched my own company--[TechKnowledge Point
Corp.](http://www.techknowledgepoint.com/)\--at SBTi in 2001. (We "graduated"
to our own facility one year later.)

There are, of course, both pros and cons to securing capital funding from the
operating partners at the incubator.

The benefits include having a hands-on team of incubator support staff working
closely with you and your company. The staff works for the incubator partners,
so they have a vested interest in seeing your firm succeed, beyond simply
collecting rent on your space. Other startups in the incubator who are also in
the investors' portfolio of companies can also develop with you a good degree
of camaraderie among the many entrepreneurs, company employees and the support
staff, as all parties get to see tangible evidence every day of each other's
struggling and working hard to be successful. The incubator investment team
will also likely have a wide range of network referrals with specific
expertise that your firm can tap into. After all, the investors want the
incubated company to grow and be profitable, so once again the vested capital
stake can serve as a powerful link to bridge your operating and strategic
needs to knowledgeable and well-connected professionals in your industry and
market space. And finally, the incubator investors may also like to take an
additional personal investment stake in your firm or have excellent referrals
to serious qualified investors who will have interest in your firm.

But the irony is that many of those benefits can also be reasons not to do
capital funding through an incubator. The incubator staff and management team
might actually end up being more of a distraction to you and your personnel,
as they may exhibit stronger allegiances to the incubator investment manager,
whose perspectives and expectations for company direction and plans may be at
odds with those of the entrepreneur. There could be various forms of
micromanaging from the incubator personnel and/or investors, with the
pervading feeling that the site staff, investment manager and even incubator
shareholders are always looking over your shoulder to monitor business
progress.

The decision to get capital through an incubator's investment fund must be
carefully evaluated, regarding both tangible financial and other intangible
costs to the startup business. But the right fit and situation could also be
the perfect place from which to gain both money to implement your business
plan, and the market/industry traction in those critical early months of the
launch, that are together the keys to your success.
