To Market?

_Business Start-Ups_ magazine, October 1999

Is this a good time to begin an investment program? You bet it is. Not because
the stock market will necessarily climb next month or next year, but because
delaying your investment efforts may jeopardize hopes for a comfortable
retirement. The sooner you start, the better. In your 20s or 30s, you have a
great opportunity to watch your investments grow over the years and the luxury
of withstanding market dips.

"Initiating an investment plan is difficult when you're starting a business
because the temptation is to plow all resources back into the business,"
acknowledges investment advisor David Young of Wood Young and Co. Inc. in
Quakertown, Pennsylvania. "But an investment program is vital. Don't wait for
the right moment to enter the market, or you might be sitting on the sidelines
forever."

"One of the biggest mistakes a young business owner can make is to ignore the
necessity of saving for the future," agrees Chris Walters, vice president and
Los Angeles regional manager of Mellon Private Asset Management, an investment
and wealth management firm for individuals with portfolios of $1 million or
more. "The majority of [a young entrepreneur's] investments should be in long-
term domestic stocks; these have historically outperformed other asset
classes. Also consider a smaller exposure in international and emerging market
funds, which offer diversification and tremendous upside potential for the
portfolio. Finally, it would be wise to include large-cap stocks, which could
offer more upside potential in the next three to five years."

If you happen to be just starting an investment program, don't fear the
market, counsels Young. "Dollar-cost averaging [periodically investing a set
amount in a stock or mutual fund] is an effective way of investing without
regard to market timing; it softens the effects of market volatility."

As does diversification. "Mutual funds are the best way to achieve
diversification, and they allow business owners more time to concentrate on
their businesses without worrying about individual stock picks," Walters says.

To avoid sales fees and commissions, look for no-load mutual funds. Many allow
monthly investments as low as $50, which can be automatically deducted from
your bank account. And talk to your accountant about SEP, Keogh and other tax-
deferred plans to help maximize benefits from the significant compounding
effect down the road.
