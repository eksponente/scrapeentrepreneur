There's No Hiding It

When The Coca-Cola Company first volunteered to treat options as an expense in
its financials as a service to shareholders, the response from the business
community was lukewarm, even skeptical. Other corporate behemoths, unexcited
by the idea of leveling earnings with a big compensation charge, were not
prepared to jump on the bandwagon. But in recent months, the trickle of
companies following in Coke's footsteps has become more of a stampede, as
businesses race to prove to investors that they, too, are dedicated to giving
investors the whole truth. Now, with the practice not yet law, but quickly
becoming the fashion of the day, small public-company CEOs have to figure out
whether to follow suit.

The debate has come a long way since 1994, when similar proposals by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) were quickly quashed. But while
the FASB has recently stated it will not revisit the idea of requiring
companies to expense options (until the International Accounting Standards
Board does so), it did decide to propose requiring that companies disclose the
value of options in the footnotes of quarterly financial statements, rather
than in their annual reports.

Other bills are still on the table. One piece of legislation, introduced by
Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), would allow companies to claim tax deductions only for
options they expense. Proponents say changes are necessary to keep companies
from lavishly doling out options to senior executives without having to
include the cost of the options on their financial statements.

But opponents argue that options don't require a cash outlay like other
expenses and are difficult to price accurately. They also contend that
companies will simply stop issuing options to anyone but the senior ranking
executives, leaving lower-level employees out in the cold.

Small-business advocates say entrepreneurs will be disproportionately
disadvantaged. Not having options-or sufficient cash-to lure talent will
hamper their ability to compete. "Bigger companies can afford to offer more
perks and benefits to attract the best people," observes John Chal-lenger, CEO
of Chicago-based outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
"It's smaller public companies that will bear the brunt of this."

"They're going to be caught between a rock and a hard place," agrees Harry
Friedman, a tax attorney in law firm Greenberg Traurig's Phoenix office,
"because while they don't have the cash to pay employees, there will be a cost
to utilizing options." Unless the market understands that these expenses
aren't actually cash expenses, he says, the lower earnings you report will
make investors angry.

Being unable to afford to offer options at all could put entrepreneurial
businesses on the losing end of the war for talent, says Karen Jorgensen, a
human resources consultant in a La CaÃ±ada, California, and the author of _Pay
for Results_ (Silver Lake Publishing). "I can tell you from a human resources
and compensation perspective that employees still demand options as part of a
company's compensation package, and they will continue to do that."

John Hollister, CFO of Cicada, a company that vends semiconductors, says
options have been a critical incentive for recruiting talent at the Austin,
Texas-based company. "High-quality design engineers are still in very high
demand, so we don't take anything for granted," he says. The company grants
options to all of its approximately 70 employees, and because it still has the
option to do so, Cicada chooses to disclose the expense in a footnote rather
than expensing it on its P&L statement.

When it comes to issuing options, Hollister adds, the more important issue is-
and should be-dilution. Investors tend to focus more on the capitalization
table, which tells them how the newly issued options impact the ownership
percentage they hold in the company.

While the final chapter in the accounting treatment of options has yet to be
written, the momentum is driving toward mandatory expensing. If that happens,
one alternative benefit that may gain favor is the employee stock purchase
plan, which doesn't stick companies with a compensation charge, but still
offers them some discount when they purchase shares. On the other hand, such a
plan doesn't offer the same long-term employee ownership that entrepreneurial
companies have sought to build. For some small public companies, the only
solution may be to go private and, in the process, forfeit access to much-
needed capital fuel. Then again, as Challenger points out, there could be
worse times to consider that.
