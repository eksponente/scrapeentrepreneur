Going After Overdue Accounts

**Introduction**

Nothing reduces a business's cash flow like unpaid bills. Particularly in a
small business, tracking down the guilty parties is both a financial and
physical drain.

To recover owed money, many businesses turn to collection agencies. These
organizations specialize in collecting payment from overdue accounts.

Most firms bring in collection agencies for debt that is about eight months
old, although a few bring in agencies after only three months.

This guide is designed to give you the facts you need to hire a collection
agency for your business. The various sections are listed in the box above.

**How Agencies Work**

Collection agencies can attempt to collect on bad debts in two ways:

**By mail and phone**  

For larger debts, they will typically send letters and make phone calls to the
delinquent account.

**By mail only**  

Smaller debts may not justify the cost of phone calls, limiting the collection
agency to simply sending threatening letters.

**Choosing a Service**

Choosing a collection service is tricky, since it's hard to predict a firm's
success with delinquent accounts ahead of time. A few areas to investigate
when choosing a collection service:

**Method of collection**

You should examine the letters that will be used and judge whether they will
be effective with your customer base. Also ask about the training that
telephone collectors receive to ensure they understand the _Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act_.

This 1977 act requires that debt collectors treat debtors fairly by
prohibiting certain methods of debt collection.

**How the service will work with you**  

Be sure to find out:

  * how information about delinquent accounts will be transferred to the agency.
  * when collected funds will be forwarded.
  * what reports are provided detailing the collection progress and success rates.
  * how you can stop collections if you receive payment or credit an account.

**How they handle skiptracing**  

This is particularly important when collecting from individuals. Skiptracing
refers to how the firm finds debtors who have disappeared and can no longer be
directly contacted. Agencies should have access to online search capabilities
and telephone databases to help locate these debtors.

**Reputation of the firm**  

Make sure to check references, particularly from clients that are in a similar
business. Also find out whether the firm complies with state licensing or
bonding laws.

**Before Hiring an Agency**

There are several actions you can take to reduce the amount owed to you before
resorting to an agency.

**Be careful when offering credit**

Carefully check credit references of each new account and don't extend more
credit than the firm can handle.

**Explain transaction terms thoroughly**

When extending credit, make sure that accounts know when you expect payment,
and clearly detail any credits or penalties for early or late payment.

**Follow up overdue accounts**

Do not expect customers to police themselves; instead, make sure to promptly
send statements and reminders of payment due dates.

**Institute a series of overdue notice**

You should schedule regular written and oral reminders before even considering
a collection agency. This will not only help save money, but will also avoid
the ill will that can be generated when using a third party to collect the
funds.

**Set an absolute due date and stick to it**

As a final step, set an absolute due date before the account is turned over to
a collection agency. Do not extend this date, but do give the debtor warning
of this final payment date.

**Pricing**

Debt collection is usually done on a contingency basis. This means that the
agency keeps a percentage of money that is collected from a debtor. Depending
on the size of the business, commissions can range from 10% to 50% of the
recovered amount. Other agencies require an upfront fee and then take a lower
percentage of the recovered amount.

The advantage of contingency billing is that you do not pay for uncollected
debts. However, some agencies will not offer contingency services for small
debts. In these cases, you will typically pay a fixed fee for a series of
letters or calls.

**Buying Tips**  

**Be thorough**  

When assigning a third party to collect an overdue account, provide them with
all the information you have about the debtor, including an itemized breakdown
of all contacts between your organization and the debtor's business or home.

**Make sure the agency you choose is licensed**  

Some states require collection agencies to be licensed in their state before
they can pursue debtors. Contact the American Collectors Association
(612/926-6547) or a particular state's collection agency administrator for
specific details on state requirements.

**Get more than the P.O. box**  

To increase the agency's chances of tracking down an individual or business,
always ask for the customer's **physical address** (even if you are sending
the materials to a Post Office box), **phone number** and **social security
number**. It can also help to work with a **credit reporting agency**. All of
this information will be helpful in tracking down individuals even if they
have closed their P.O. box or changed their address and phone number.
