Managing Your Debt

Only a short time after husband-and-wife entrepreneurs Karen Cooley and Eric
Favier bought a friend's restaurant in 1991, they had their first taste of
success. Sales at their Tallahassee, Florida, restaurant, Chez Pierre, had
more than doubled in response to savvy marketing and expanded kitchen hours.
But after five successful years at the location, the federal government
acquired the restaurant's property to expand a nearby courthouse. "We were
given one of those 'When life gives you lemons, make lemonade' kind of
scenarios, and we had to move our business," says Cooley, 48.

So the couple took another leap of faith, buying and renovating a commercial
building for $1.2 million to house the restaurant. It marked a major
entrepreneurial milestone for Cooley and Favier, who had previously leased
restaurant space from the original Chez Pierre owners. Not only did they now
own their own building, but they were also knee-deep in debt because of the
purchase. "It was really challenging, and we weren't sure where to go next
[or] what to do," says Cooley.

For help managing the debt and charting a new course for the business, the
couple turned to The Jim Moran Institute for Global Entrepreneurship at
Florida State University. Among other things, they were advised to intensify
marketing and build up sales to help offset the loan payments. Eventually,
sales more than doubled to nearly $2 million annually in response to their
strong marketing efforts. Marketing strategies included community networking,
such as raising money for causes like cancer research, and publicizing the
restaurant's off-site catering and other services. "We had many sleepless
nights," Cooley says of their decision. "But it has turned out to be
absolutely the right thing to do. We have so many different avenues for
growing our business right now."

The couple has since added team operating partner David Michael Sprowles and
is gearing up for another round of financing to further boost sales. Cooley
and Favier, 50, plan to build an outdoor dining area that will include a wood-
burning pizza oven and a seafood bar. "If you're going to take on more debt,"
Cooley says, "it not only has to generate enough in sales and profitability to
take care of the debt service, but [also] put money back in the coffers.

"None of us has a crystal ball," she explains. "You're always trying to find
that balance between having a successful business that is growing organically
and knowing when it's time to go beyond that and put in more investment for
infrastructure or new facilities. It's tough to do."

A Balancing Act  
Indeed, taking on the right amount of debt can mean the difference between a
business struggling to survive and one that can respond nimbly to changing
economic or market conditions. A number of circumstances may justify acquiring
debt. As a general rule, borrowing makes the most sense when you need to
bolster cash flow or finance growth or expansion. But while debt can provide
the leverage you need to grow, too much debt can strangle your business. So
the question is: How much debt is too much?

The answer, experts say, lies in a careful analysis of your cash flow as well
as your industry. "A business that doesn't grow dies," says Jerry Osteryoung,
executive director of The Jim Moran Institute. "You've got to grow, but you've
got to grow within the financial constraints of your business. What is the
ideal capital structure a business needs in its industry to remain viable? The
higher the volatility [in your industry], the less debt you should have. The
smaller the volatility, the more debt you can afford."

Do Your Homework  
To find out where your business stands, carefully examine your company's debt-
to-equity ratio, which can help you keep debt within reasonable limits. The
ratio is derived by looking at a company's long-term debt divided by its
equity. Lower ratios typically indicate that the business is well within its
borrowing capacity and can weather cyclical or seasonal downturns. Bear in
mind, however, that this benchmark can vary widely by industry. As a result,
you will want to identify a debt-to-equity ratio specific to your business,
which can reveal whether you need to pay down debt, postpone borrowing plans
or even secure an investment to get your business on track. To get started,

Although banks and other financial institutions look for a satisfactory debt-
to-equity ratio before agreeing to make a loan, don't assume a creditor's
willingness to extend funds is evidence that your business is in a strong debt
position. Some financial institutions are overzealous lenders, particularly
when trying to lure or hold on to promising business customers. "I've seen
cases where banks have [lent] way too much to a business," Osteryoung says.

Grant Lacerte, owner of Winter Haven, [Florida-based Financial Research
Associates](http://www.frafssb.com/), agrees. "The bank may be looking more at
collateral than whether the [business's] earnings are going to come in to
justify the debt service," says Lacerte, whose company publishes small-
business financial studies.

As an owner of two businesses, Lacerte says he is constantly inundated with
credit card offers for working capital and lines of credit, many from large
banking institutions. "The bank is not [conducting] any financial analysis on
the business's financials," he says. "They just go by the creditworthiness of
the firm based on its past bill-paying experience. They're not looking at the
real worth of the business and the ongoing ability to pay off that debt.

"In the old days, a commercial loan officer would do a credit analysis.
[Today,] I see small businesses not even doing seven figures in revenue
[being] offered a $100,000 credit line just like that," Lacerte says.

To avoid these and other credit pitfalls, it's up to you to get the financial
facts on your business and make sound borrowing decisions. Unfortunately, many
entrepreneurs fail to recognize how important financial analysis is to running
a successful business. Even business owners who receive detailed financial
statements from their accountants often do not take advantage of the valuable
information contained in the documents.

Even though getting a handle on these things might seem like an intimidating
task, not having an accounting degree is no excuse, says Lacerte, who is
developing a web-based subscription service to let business owners submit
their financial information to compare it with key industry benchmarks. "With
QuickBooks and [other kinds of] available software, [business owners] can
extract the information they need," he says. "It's just a little educational
process to understand what those ratios mean and let them be warning signs
that they're going to get themselves into trouble."
