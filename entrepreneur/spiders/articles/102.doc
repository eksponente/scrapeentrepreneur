The Formula for a Thriving Product Business

Everyone wants to know what is really needed to start a successful business.
How can I be sure the timing is right? How much capital do I need? Is this
product truly worthy? There are so many questions to consider. I’m sure many
of them are swirling in your brain right now.

I’m not going to mince words. Starting a business is inherently risky. You are
going to have to be willing to take a leap of faith, to one degree or another.

In the early aughts, I founded a guitar accessory company with my longtime
friend Rob Stefani. Friends and family thought I was crazy. What did I know
about the music industry? "You don’t even know how to play the guitar!" they
said. But I was confident that he and I were onto something. I saw that the
stars had aligned. He had spent years working in the industry. We knew someone
locally who was successful doing what we wanted to do. We saw that our
competitors hadn’t innovated in decades. And there was the fact that most
retailers were small independent stores, which we bet would be willing to
gamble on our unusual designs.

There was a distinct opportunity and we had the resources to take advantage of
it. So we went for it. We ended up growing our business from a tiny operation
based out of my dining room to 7-Eleven and WalMart in a short time.

The more entrepreneurs I talk to, the more convinced I have become that there
is actually a formula of sorts for starting a successful business. For
starters, successful entrepreneurs don’t rush in. It takes time to ensure that
the four factors needed to get a business up and running are in place.

Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting Chris Handy, an entrepreneur who
successfully funded his idea for a new type of card game on Kickstarter
earlier this year. When I heard he was launching a business in the gaming
industry, I scoffed. I worked for a toy startup -- I know firsthand how hard
that industry is to break into. But after listening to his story, I’m excited
for him. He’s hit the formula on the head.

To start a successful business, this is what is needed:

## 1\. Familiarity with the industry

To start a successful business, you must understand the landscape.
Unsurprisingly, Handy told me that he has always been a fan of games. It
wasn’t until the year 2000 that he began designing his own, but even before
that, he was thinking about prototypes. For the past decade and a half, Handy
has been licensing his ideas for games.

To learn about the retail side of the industry, he launched an ecommerce site
that sells hobby market games a few years ago. His Kickstarter campaign was
successful in part because he was so knowledgeable about the industry.

## 2\. Connections/relationships

Because he’s spent so much time in the industry, Handy has a lot of contacts.
He says he’s been attending the hobby game industry’s most important annual
gathering for the past six years. As a result, he has an army of peers he can
reach out to for support and advice. He knows who’s who in manufacturing and
retail. That’s crucial.

## 3\. A unique product

What sets your product apart from your competitors? What is your point of
difference? What kinds of benefits does your product offer? Handy says he
became convinced that the Pack O Game line, gum-pack sized card games that can
be played anywhere, was the right product to launch his own publishing brand
because even non-gamers were intrigued by it.

“It appealed to people in a way that none of my other games have,” Handy
explains. “Even my parents, who have never been interested in playing my other
games, wanted to play these.”

## 4\. Unique packaging

The Pack O Game’s size sets it apart. It’s quick to play and portable -- so it
can be played before eating dinner at a restaurant or in the airport, for
example. It’s also affordable to print and allows for an infinite amount of
different designs. Visually, it doesn’t look like other games. It stands out.
My guess is Handy will be able to sell it in non-typical retail outlets
because of that. He has found his niche.

Handy has the exact same strengths that I had when my partner and I launched
our business.

Do you have what it takes?
