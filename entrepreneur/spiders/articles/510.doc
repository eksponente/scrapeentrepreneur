Using Credit Cards to Fund Your Business

Most surveys of entrepreneurs show that credit cards are among the most
popular sources of startup financing. The [Pioneer
Institute](http://www.pioneerinstitute.org/) , for example, found that loans
from relatives and borrowing against credit cards were the two most common
financing techniques used by startups with less than five employees. Despite
this high rate of usage, the terms of credit-card financing are poorly
understood. How many entrepreneurs take the time to read the card issuer's
Terms of Use when they respond to a new credit-card offer in the mail? This
month's column provides some guidance to entrepreneurs who plan to use credit-
card debt as a financing technique and wish to understand the implications of
its personal guarantee.

Most entrepreneurs shudder when faced with signing a personal guarantee for a
business credit card for the first time. I've never really understood how
banks can market a product as a "business line of credit" when it's really a
personal line of credit. However, since the vast majority of businesses in the
country are sole proprietorships, the difference between personal credit and
business credit is murky from a bank's perspective. Unless your business is
incorporated, you're the _de facto_ guarantor of all business debts. So if
your business has a slow sales quarter and you fall behind on your credit-card
payments, your personal credit rating and your personal ability to borrow are
at risk. (For more information on how to build your business's credit score,

Even if your business is incorporated, your bank or credit-card issuer may
still require you to guarantee the business line of credit. In practice, most
banks require shareholders with significant ownership in corporations to
guarantee business lines of credit--typically owners with more than a
25-percent stake are required to sign guarantee forms when credit lines are
more than $5,000. Moreover, most guarantee forms require joint and several
liabilities, implying that all guarantors are responsible for the whole amount
of the debt, even if they're not full owners of the business. The guarantors
can be sued individually or all together. (This tends to vary from state to
state, so check with your attorney for details.)

If you're attracting new partners to your business, be sure to include a
provision in the partnership agreement that commits them to accept a personal
guarantee on all existing business debt. In many states, new partners aren't
automatically responsible for previous debts, so this issue must be addressed
specifically. The goal is to spread the liability as widely as possible to
reduce the risk to any one individual.

Keep in mind that if you're establishing a credit line with a community bank
or local small-business lender, there may be some room for negotiation. For
example, it's possible to request that certain personal assets be excluded
from the guarantee or that the guaranteed percentage of the loan declines as
the business matures or surpasses a certain net-worth threshold. Private loans
from relatives and other business associates are also subject to negotiation.
However, for credit-card issuers, the offer for business credit is usually a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition--and you must accept the personal guarantee if
you want the card.

For small businesses struggling to find funding, borrowing against a credit
card can be an attractive--if not the only--option. Plunging further into
credit-card debt is a scary proposition, but for many the outcome has been
rewarding. If you feel using a credit card to fund all or part of your
business is the best option for you, be sure to read the fine print before
responding to your next credit-card offer in the mail. Understanding the risks
before you accept the offer can save you a lot of financial pain in the
future.
