Using Your Own Money to Grow

Entrepreneurs generally have their sights set on rapid and prolonged growth of
sales and market share in their targeted market space. But the way to go about
meeting that objective is always the pressing challenge for the typical
emerging enterprise.

Sometimes the market is so ready for the new venture's product or service that
keeping up with customer demand actually becomes a problem for the business.
This can often happen without much of a concerted marketing effort or highly
detailed advertising and promotions plans. It's all about being in the right
place, at the right time, and with just the right price relative to the
competition.

In other situations, an entrepreneur develops and implements a very specific
strategic plan and then navigates the company on a long-range course to meet
targeted milestones in sales and volume over time. In this case, it's all
about maneuvering across the competitive landscape, one new account or
distribution channel at a time, on a calculated and incremental growth-curve.

Regardless of the type of growth scenario you're involved in, the question
that is often left unanswered is how you're going to pay for that growth.
Remember, increasing sales revenues and moving greater volume out the door is
expensive. Here are the major expenses you'll encounter when trying to grow
your company:

  * Recruiting, hiring and training new employees, both regular staff and managers
  * Increased customer service and support for the new buyers
  * Increased advertising, promotions and marketing budgets
  * Buying materials in larger lot sizes leading to larger total invoices
  * Increased administrative and other technical and office support
  * Increased information technology capabilities and IT support
  * Increased manufacturing capabilities (for example, machinery, equipment and vehicles)
  * More floor space in offices
  * More floor space in manufacturing and production areas
  * More floor space in warehousing and shipping/receiving

Expanding your company requires capital to pay for all this new
infrastructure. The plain and simple fact is the money will have to either
come from within your business, or from sources outside of it. Expansion with
internally generated funds can be a very difficult process to plan for and
realize. The main consideration is whether there'll be sufficient room within
the normal internal cash flows to pay for the expansion outlays.

First, you have to determine whether your business model has sufficient
"margin spacing" to support cash allocations toward growth. Margin spacing
refers to the capacity of your business's gross profit margin and operating
profit margin to accommodate contributions toward expansion-oriented
allocations, outside the normal flow of daily operations.

It works like this. Let's say you have a product priced at $100 with a cost of
goods sold of $60 and a $40 gross profit (40 percent gross margin). After your
normal fixed overhead is accounted for, you have a 20 percent operating margin
on a pre-tax basis. Assuming 35 percent will go to taxes, you end up with 13
cents net after-tax profit for every $1 of sales. Next, add back in any
depreciation deductions, and that result is your net after-tax cash flow
(ATCF).

You can then calculate how much of that ATCF will be distributed to your
shareholders and other investors in the form of cash dividends, if there are
any. The remaining ATCF balance is the net available for investment (NAI).
Whatever this dollar value is, it's then divided by the total revenue to find
a percentage margin. Looking back on our example and assuming the total
dollar-value depreciation has been factored in and a certain cash distribution
is made to the shareholders, you might have an NAI of 10.25 percent (margin on
sales revenue).

You must now make reasonable projections of sales revenue on a quarterly basis
over the next two to four years, depending on the length of the growth
"window" being planned for, and then apply an expected NAI to that. This will
create a map of the ATCF that's available for investment into expansion
spending. The NAI margin must be shown as a component of the gross margin,
operating margin and net margin for your company in order to chart the margin
spacing or free cash flow that should be happening at each stage of the profit
and loss statement. When a gross margin gets reduced due to price decreases
and/or labor and material cost increases, the margin spacing for eventual NAI
is also reduced. The same can be said for much higher overhead, which also
reduces NAI spacing. On the other hand, if your production costs can be
reduced with steady or higher prices, or overhead can be reduced
disproportionately compared to increased sales, your NAI margin spacing will
increase.

You'll have to compare your quarterly projected NAI from sales and all
operating cost projections to determine whether the margin spacing is
sufficient to generate funds for your expansion "wish list" of new purchases
and investments. If, over time, the NAI can be matched to the expansion
allocations, then you may not have to seek outside funds to move forward with
your growth plan. But if the NAI can't keep pace with the planned uses of
funds scheduled, then you'll have to consider raising external sources of
capital in order to stay on track with your expansion plan.
