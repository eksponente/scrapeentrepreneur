How to Develop Software That Sells Itself

Entrepreneurs are do-it-yourself types, and while the path of raising venture
capital funding to support your endeavor is a thrill ride, building a company
without outside money is a special and exhilarating kind of accomplishment all
its own.

Our company started with no money. The first server was under a table in my
home, doubling as a footrest. In growing our business without teams for sales,
marketing or customer support, we discovered several very effective things you
can still do if you make your product do those things for you.

## 1\. You can market with no money.

Starting out as a new entrant in a highly competitive marketplace, marketing
can be your only chance to spread the word about your product and survive.
With no money, it’s time to get resourceful and use what you do have.

If all you have is your product, barter. Find places online where you can buy
traffic in exchange for free software. Find the relevant forums and social
networks to help grow your initial base. Building up positive feedback gets
the ball rolling and leads to additional attention and referrals.

## 2\. Offer a free version the right way.

When offering free and paid versions of your software, recognize the careful
balancing act you’re performing and give it the thought it requires.

Making your free version too limited can increase conversions from free to
paid, but will also reduce the user base trying out the software and
recommending it to other companies, thus slowing your new user growth.
However, if the free version includes too much functionality, fewer users will
upgrade to the paid version, reducing your revenue.

There is an optimal balance between growing your user base and revenue that
you should always be mindful of achieving. The features and functionality of
your free version are your control levers.

## 3\. Design your product to support itself.

The best way to grow without a dedicated support department is to make your
product do the work. Design your product so that customers can get the most
out of it without any support from you. Even at the expense of product
functionality, a reduced load on your help desk provides business efficiency
that a young company needs.

Pay close attention to your user interface, and include clear, specific
instructions. Nobody reads tooltips longer than four lines, and if users don’t
understand what button to press? Well, it isn’t their problem, it’s yours.

Keeping the product simple not only reduces support costs, it also affects
sales at all stages. A simple product is more likely to be tried out, and
clear benefits of the different versions increase paid conversions.

## 4\. Make your product your sales team.

When optimizing for conversions, treat your interface as a salesperson.
Develop every page or segment of your interface to provide motivation to
upgrade to the paid version. With each visual or piece of text, consider: how
are we showcasing the paid features?

It is possible to sell without salespeople if you place information about your
feature set and the benefits of your paid version properly.

## 5\. Employ an email robot.

Automated emails can be very helpful in sending repeat invitations to upgrade
to the paid version to every new customer. If a user hasn’t upgraded after a
couple of months, a good tactic is to send them a discount coupon. Testing and
optimizing your mailings as you gain more understanding of your user base
should yield improvements.

A product designed to sell and support itself can grow your company
organically, and, of course, offers the advantages of simplicity and cost-
effectiveness. This model can help you preserve your independence, grow fast
and keep keenly aware of your customers’ experiences as you adapt your product
to their needs.
