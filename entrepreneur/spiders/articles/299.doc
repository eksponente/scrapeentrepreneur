Do Tips Count as Income?

The restaurant industry and other small businesses employing workers who
receive tips recently took a hit from the Supreme Court. In June, the court
ruled that the IRS has the right to charge restaurants additional Social
Security taxes if it believes employees are underreporting their tips.

Seven out of 10 restaurants are small businesses, many of which operate with
slim margins, says Peter Kilgore, general counsel and senior vice president of
operations for the National Restaurant Association. The restaurant industry
maintains that holding employers liable when the IRS fails to determine which
workers failed to report tips pits restaurant owners against their own
employees.

The case of _Fior d'Italia v. the U.S._ involved a claim of underpayed tip
taxes by the San Francisco restaurant. After a federal district court and a
federal appeals court ruled in the restaurant's favor, government lawyers
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case.

The ruling comes as the IRS is expected to step up its audits of restaurants,
says Bill Zaagman, director of government affairs for the Michigan Restaurant
Association. As a result, more restaurants are likely to enter into a TRAC
(Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment) agreement with the IRS to limit their
exposure to these audits. Under a TRAC, an employer promises to set up a
system where employees are provided a written statement of charged tips
attributed to the employee. In addition, the restaurant agrees to educate
employees about the need to report 100 percent of all tips.

Says Zaagman: "The ruling affirms the actions the IRS has been taking with
regard to audits of restaurant employers. Our next step is to go to Congress
and ask for redress there."
