Selling Your Business With Seller Financing

While it's true that fewer business-for-sale deals are being made during the
recession, it's not because potential buyers aren't looking. Across the
country, there is plenty of buy interest in businesses, but a shortage of
financing is keeping many deals from getting off the ground. As a result,
sellers willing to finance at least part of a business sale are finding it
much easier to get their businesses sold.  
  
By offering seller financing, a business seller allows a buyer to make a down
payment, agreeing to carry a note for the remainder of the purchase price.
This way, the buyer only has to come up with a portion of the total price up
front and can then pay off the remainder over time.  
  
A seller's willingness to finance a portion of a business sale has always been
a strong selling point for potential buyers, but in recent months it has
become essential to many deals. With most business buyers unable to access the
full amount of a business price from lending institutions, today's sellers are
faced with the decision to either lower asking prices or work with buyers to
overcome sale barriers.  
  
While seller financing could be the key in attracting buyers and taking a sale
to completion, sellers should be aware that it comes with risks. Here's what
sellers need to know if they are considering "being the bank."  
  
**Be Aware of the Risk**  
There's no doubt that seller financing is an important part of today's
business sales, but the fact remains that it's not the right approach for
every seller. Before making the decision, sellers should evaluate owner-
financing as a business investment that undoubtedly comes with risk. When
providing financing, a seller stays tied to the business long after the sale
has been made, counting on the new owner to turn profit and pay back the
principal with interest. Unfortunately, success under the new owner is not
guaranteed, and there's a chance the seller will face the loss of interest
income and extra costs associated with collecting debt. For this reason,
sellers should make sure they are confident with the promise of the business
and the prospective new owner before financing a sale.  
  
**Require a Down Payment**  
Even after they've made the decision to offer financing, sellers shouldn't
waive a buyer's significant down payment on the business. This way, they can
minimize their risk by distributing a larger portion of it to buyers. It's
usually in a seller's best interest to finance no more than one-third to two-
thirds of the sale price, letting the rest fall on the buyer. In certain cases
where a seller has a vested interest - such as selling to a family member -
financing more than this is acceptable, but as the amount increases, so does
the risk.  
  
**Use Financing to Your Advantage**  
Many sellers view self-financing as a last-ditch attempt to sell a business,
but it can actually offer benefits that cash sales don't. Sellers can
typically sell their businesses for 15 percent more by advertising a
willingness to provide financing. Sellers can also use financing to multiply
the principal value of a business through buyers' future interest payments.
Most financed sales can bring in an average of 8 to 10 percent interest over a
5 to 7 year note.  
  
**Get Outside Help When Necessary**  
The idea of owner-financing might come with a do-it-yourself mindset, but
trying to go it alone can lead to complications during a transaction. A loan
between a buyer and seller comes with a great deal of structures and
variations that require input from legal and financial professionals to
properly secure loan terms, collateral and adequate insurance coverage. Using
these professionals when appropriate, can help sellers avoid headaches and
sell their businesses much more smoothly.  
  
**Don't Be Pressured**  
No matter how important seller financing has become in today's business-for-
sale marketplace, sellers who have done their homework and still aren't
comfortable with the idea of offering it simply shouldn't do so. It's not rare
for potential business buyers to try to strong-arm sellers into offering
financing, but that's never a legitimate reason for sellers to go ahead with
it. There's always an underlying reason why a seller doesn't feel comfortable
with owner-financing, and going against this gut feeling could lead to regret.
Owners on the fence can benefit greatly from arranging a meeting with someone
who sold a business using seller financing and can speak from experience.
Acting as the bank can allow owners to sell faster and reap financial
benefits, but in the end every seller should step back and assess their
individual situation before making the leap into seller financing.
