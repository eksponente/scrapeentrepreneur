Choosing the Right Financial Professional

A reader recently e-mailed me this question: "I'm starting a small business
and will need some help with the financial side of things. What's the
difference between a bookkeeper, an accountant and a certified public
accountant (CPA), and which professional is right for my business?"

To get the right answer, I went to someone with a little experience in the
financial field. Linda Hunt, president of
[SumSolutions](http://www.sumsolutions.com) , a financial and management
consulting firm in Trumbull, Connecticut, says that there are actually four
types of accounting professionals.

First, there are bookkeepers who record your daily business transactions but
don't prepare or file your tax returns. According to Hunt, bookkeepers come in
two varieties. A "basic" bookkeeper is basically a clerk who can handle your
accounts receivable and payable records, and perhaps take care of your payroll
each week. A "full charge" bookkeeper, on the other hand, can handle a wider
variety of more complex transactions. "Since most small businesses look for
someone who can handle all their financial transactions, they should always
look for a full charge bookkeeper," advises Hunt.

Then there are accountants and CPAs. Contrary to popular belief (and to what a
lot of CPAs will tell you), Hunt says there's really no difference between the
services that accountants and CPAs provide. "A CPA has met the requirements of
state law and has a license or certificate from the state, says Hunt. "When
you're an accountant, you study the same things but you don't take the state
exam." Both accountants and CPAs can help you prepare your tax returns and
organize your books and records, Hunt explains, but only CPAs can file your
tax return as a "paid preparer" or audit your financial statements.

Lastly, Hunt points out that there's a fourth accounting professional: the
"enrolled agent" who falls somewhere between an accountant and a CPA. Often a
former IRS employee, an enrolled agent is "not an accountant or lawyer, but
someone who understands the federal and state tax laws, has sat for an exam,
and can file your tax return as a paid preparer," according to Hunt. In Hunt's
view, enrolled agents are usually more knowledgeable than accountants because
they're held to a higher standard of education and performance, but are not as
knowledgeable as CPAs or tax lawyers.

So which one do you choose? Hunt believes it's best to have both a bookkeeper
and either an accountant, enrolled agent or CPA. "An accountant or CPA knows
what the tax deductions are, what's legal and illegal, and your bookkeeper
isn't trained to do that," explains Hunt, "but accountants and CPAs usually
charge a lot of money to record your business transactions. A bookkeeper is
usually a lot less expensive."
