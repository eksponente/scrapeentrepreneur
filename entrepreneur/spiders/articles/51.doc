Why You Should Pay Yourself First in Business (And How to Do It Right)

**[Attend Lewis Howes' FREE webinar 11/13](http://theschoolofgreatness.leadpages.net/11-13-entrepreneur/)**

If you’ve been in business long, you no doubt know the old profits adage:
Sales – Expenses = Profits.

Today’s guest on [The School of Greatness](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast
/the-school-of-greatness/id596047499) turns this formula on its head in his
new book, Profit First, by proposing a different formula (hint: the profits
come before the expenses.)

Before you call him crazy, let me introduce Mike Michalowicz as the former
small business columnist for _The Wall Street Journal_, as well as a frequent
guest lecturer at major universities. He hosted the reality television program
_Bailout!_, where he would turn around failing businesses in 24 hours, and he
is the “Business Rescue” segment host for MSNBC’s Your Business.

He is also known for his entrepreneurial strategy (and title of his previous
book) _The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur_.  Let’s dive in to learn how to pay
yourself profits first in Episode 93 with Mike Michalowicz.
