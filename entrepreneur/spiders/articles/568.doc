The Art of Negotiating

Negotiating is a part of everyday life, but in business it's absolutely
critical to your success. Poor negotiation can cripple a company just as
quickly as losing key customers. While most negotiating strategies seem like
common sense, it's not uncommon for people to get caught up in the emotion of
the moment and ignore their basic instincts. Emotion, luck and magic have no
place in a successful negotiation. It takes an iron gut, homework, street
smarts and unblinking discipline. These keys will unlock your ability to get
the best deal possible under any circumstances.

While experienced negotiators sometimes refer to their methods as the
"negotiating game," it's really a misnomer for a process in which the stakes
are often extremely high. Check your ego at the door and keep your eye on the
big picture at all times. This is all about business.

Preparation is Key  
Know about the party you're negotiating with so you can capitalize on your
strengths and the party's weaknesses. If the other party is very experienced,
that means he also has a history that could contain useful information. If
possible, talk to business associates who have dealt with this person before.
Many negotiators develop patterns and certain styles that you may be able to
use to your advantage.

If you are a buyer, make sure you are thoroughly familiar with the product or
service that will be the subject of the negotiation. If the other party senses
you are weak on such details, you may be a prime target for a bluff or another
technique designed to create anxiety and uncertainty. Psychology plays a
crucial role in your ability to make the most of the other party's lack of
preparation and anticipate their next move.

Most negotiators have a price target or goal in mind before they start. It
should be based on realistic expectations considering all the constraints that
will undoubtedly surface. These may include budget limits, direction from
management, pressure to make sales goals, and a myriad of other external
forces. During the course of the negotiation, the goal may change based on
changes in scope and other unforeseen actions by either party. While your
ultimate goal should be realistic, this should not constrain your first offer
or counteroffer.

Before you start the negotiation, ensure that the other party is fully
empowered to make binding commitments. You don't want to find yourself in a
position where you believe you've struck a deal, only to discover that your
agreement must be approved by someone higher in the chain of command.

Have a Strategy  
There are basic principles that apply to every negotiation. The first offer is
usually the most important and the benchmark by which all subsequent offers
will be judged and compared. You'll never get what you don't ask for, so make
your first offer bold and aggressive. The asking price is just that, and will
typically include a pad or margin to give away during negotiations. You want
to take all of that and hopefully more, so start lower than the seller
expects. Don't worry about insulting the other party. As long as your offer is
not ridiculous, the other side will continue the negotiations in hopes of
settling at a better number.

As a buyer, do not disclose your budget or other limitations in your
negotiating position. A favorite ploy of salesmen is to reshuffle the product
specifications, schedule and other parameters in order to sell you an inferior
product to fit your budget. You want the best product you can get for the
money you have to spend, so employ an approach that maintains the possibility
of spending less than you had originally planned.

Always have something to give away without hurting your negotiating position.
If you're submitting a price proposal to a buyer, consider inserting decoys
and red herrings for the other party to find. For example, if you are bidding
a project, consider including some nice-to-have items that aren't critical to
the success of the project. You could also include spare parts that may or may
not be needed in the end. If the buyer takes those items out to reduce the
overall cost, you haven't lost anything but it may help the buyer reach his
price target. Such distractions will help to divert the other party from
attacking the meat of your proposal. Employing this strategy must be viewed in
the context and in consideration of what other bidders may be doing. If you
know that the only way to win the bid is to provide a barebones cost, then
this strategy may not be appropriate.

Watch for clues such as body movement, speech patterns and reactions to what
you say. Be prepared to suspend or cancel negotiations if you feel things are
getting nowhere or the other party seems stuck in their position. Indicate
your reluctance to continue under those conditions and make the other side
wonder if you are ever coming back. If they are on the hook to cut a deal,
they will feel the pressure to move. Be patient even if the other party isn't.
This can be difficult for those with a passion for instant gratification, but
the last thing you want is for the other party to think you're under the gun
to finish quickly.

From a contractual standpoint, a counteroffer automatically rejects all
previous offers. Once an offer is made, you should expect an acceptance or
rejection of your offer, or a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation open. If
your offer is rejected and you are asked to submit a new and better offer, do
not fall into that trap. That would be tantamount to negotiating with
yourself, and you should never do this. If the last offer on the table is
yours, always insist on a counteroffer to force the other party to move
his/her position before you make another offer.

Find the Leverage  
In addition to exploiting the other party's weaknesses, concentrate on taking
maximum advantage of your strengths. If you're the only source available for a
particular product, you have tremendous leverage across the board. If economic
conditions have created a market in which the product you're selling is in
great demand and low supply, that gives you more bargaining power to name your
price. If you are the buyer in a depressed economy, you normally have the
advantage of too much supply and lower demand. The current housing situation
is a classic example of what happens when supply vastly outweighs the demand
and market prices fall dramatically.

Establish a strong foundation early in the process by demonstrating your
knowledge and expertise of the negotiation subject matter. This may intimidate
those on the other side and put them on their heels before they've a chance to
establish their own credibility. Playing catch-up in a tough negotiation can
be challenging, so it's much better to take the initiative and steer the
process in the direction you want.

The Offer  
An offer is more than just a dollar amount. It must encompass all of the
elements of the bargain and will normally comprise the basis for a contract
that formalizes the agreement. If you make an offer without nailing down all
of the specifics, you may find out later that there was no meeting of the
minds with the other party. The basis of the bargain should include: offer
price (in proper denomination), statement of work (scope), identification and
quantities of goods or services, delivery schedule, performance incentives (if
any), express warranties (if any), terms and conditions, and any documents
incorporated by reference.

Trading one element for another--such as a lower price for a more relaxed
schedule--is a common tactic. These bargaining chips should be kept in your
hip pocket until you need them to close the deal and get the price you want.
While your primary focus is normally on price, you should always keep all the
other components of the deal in the forefront of your mind. Don't be pressured
into accepting boilerplate contracts represented as the "standard of the
industry" or something that "we always use." Everything, including the fine
print, is open to change. If the other party refuses to alter onerous terms,
consider taking your business elsewhere.

To avoid misunderstandings, offers should be presented in writing and include
all elements of the bargain. It's a good idea to keep notes containing the
rationale for each offer. While these notes won't be disclosed to the other
party, they will prove to be invaluable should things go awry and you need to
restart negotiations. Part of the process is benefiting from lessons learned
and refining your approach and technique. If you work for a company or the
government, those notes are usually required to document the negotiated
outcome and complete the contract file.

Go For a Win-Win Solution  
Throughout the negotiation, try to determine what you believe to be an
acceptable outcome for the other party. It may be a combination of different
things that aren't necessarily tied solely to price. For example, the delivery
date may be the most important thing to the other party, while product quality
may be your primary driver.

Understanding the other side's priorities is just as important as
understanding your own, so figure out what you would do if you were in his
shoes. When constructing your offers, attempt to satisfy some of his
priorities if doing so doesn't weaken your overall position. Be prepared to
give up the little things in exchange for the big things you don't want to
concede. Know your limits and how far you're willing to go on all aspects of
the deal.

While you have the power to influence the negotiation process in your favor,
your goal should be to secure a good deal without extracting the last pound of
flesh from the other party. This is especially true if you will be negotiating
with the same party on a recurring basis. The most effective negotiators are
professionals who know their business and don't let personalities and
irrational behavior interfere with their mission. They are capable of making
the other party believe they got the best deal they could under the
circumstances.

Once the negotiation is completed, you want to be able to work effectively
with those in the other party during contract performance. If they are
threatened and pounded into submission, they probably won't negotiate with you
again, possibly cutting off any future business. While heated confrontation is
a common occurrence during negotiations, at some point collaboration and
compromise are needed to get a deal.

Closing the Deal  
Successful negotiation is like horse-trading in that it requires a sense of
timing, creativity, keen awareness and the ability to anticipate the other
party's next move. Negotiation is also like chess in that each move should be
designed to set up not only your next move, but several moves down the line.
Generally, your moves should get progressively smaller, and you can expect the
same from the other party.

Always have the endgame in mind as you plot your strategy, and be prepared at
some point to split the remaining difference. It's almost inevitable when the
parties are close but can't seem to make that last leap to a single number.
It's completely arbitrary, but it gets the job done. That's why all the offers
leading up to that point are so important: they will set the stage for the
final handshake.
