Don't Go There

_Business Start-Ups_ magazine, July 1999

How important is money to the success of your business? Very. "Often it's not
the lack of a business plan, lack of foresight or lack of competent management
that leads to failure. Rather, it's a lack of capital--even in businesses that
are thriving," says Larry London, managing director of Entrepreneurs Re$ource
Group in Dunedin, Florida. "In fact, a survey of successful business owners
[conducted last November by Geneva Business Bank] concluded that the largest
potential trouble spot is when a company is experiencing rapid growth."

London says the eight most common mistakes made by entrepreneurs are:

  * Failing to borrow funds
  * Overlooking available financial resources
  * Underestimating financial risks
  * Ignoring the downside of having investors
  * Making unrealistic estimates of your borrowing potential
  * Neglecting to manage lender relationships
  * Preparing a loan application under pressure
  * Failing to forecast cash needs

There are a number of other common errors, of course, London adds. "Most
notably, too many small businesses borrow relative to their cash flow and
don't leave enough money to run the business. That is, the business owner
borrows as much money as he knows he can repay based on cash flow. But with
payments going to service that debt, the business doesn't have enough money
left for growth."

More details are spelled out in a brochure London wrote, _The 8 Biggest
Financial Mistakes Business Owners Make--and How to Avoid Them_. For a copy,
