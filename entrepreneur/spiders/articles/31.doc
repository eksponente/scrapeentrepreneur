Peter Thiel's Very Negative -- And Very Useful -- Advice for Entrepreneurs

Maybe you can tell something about the Zeitgeist of the business world by
looking at what business people are reading at airports. In the white-collar
recession angst of the early 1990s, for example, they were desperately
flipping through the cost-cutting manifesto _Reengineering The Corporation_.
During the China panic a decade ago, it was Thomas Friedman’s _The World Is
Flat_. When the financial crisis exploded in 2008, and blew their neat little
spreadsheets to smithereens, they turned to Nassim Taleb’s _The Black Swan_,
about the power of the unpredictable, to find out why.

Today, the Nasdaq is surging, young companies such as Facebook and Twitter and
Uber and AirBnB are turning established industries upside down, and a new
generation of dot-com wannabes are dreaming of starting their own revolution.
So Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur Peter Thiel has probably picked the
perfect moment to publish _Zero To One: Notes On Startups, or How to Build the
Future_.

Thiel has a remarkable track record. He co-launched PayPal and sold it to eBay
for billions. Then, as a venture capitalist, he was among the early backers of
Facebook, LinkedIn, Spotify, and Yelp. It says something about Thiel’s clout
that the marketing materials for the book have come with gushing reviews from
Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Nassim Taleb, and even GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt.

Okay, so you’re a young dot-com wannabe in San Francisco—or New York, or
London, or Taipei—thinking of jumping on the bandwagon and launching your own
venture. Your company will be the next Uber or Square or so on. What advice
does Thiel have for you?

Lots. Some of it is buried, or revealed in passing. And upon looking back
through _Zero To One_ I realized most of the really interesting advice is
negative. Don’t.

So… don’t try to “disrupt” an existing industry: instead, try to fill a need
that nobody else knows exists. Don’t get overwhelmed by uncertainty. Don’t
diversify. Don’t hire consultants.

Don’t have part-time employees (“Ken Kesey was right: you’re either on the bus
or off the bus.”) Don’t pay your CEO too much and don’t pay staff lots of cash
instead of stock.

Don’t have a board of more than three to five people. Don’t offer incremental
advances. Don’t bother launching a new technology unless it is “an order of
magnitude” or “10X” better than what exists today.

Don’t play little ball—swing for home runs. Don’t listen to the mainstream.
Don’t be afraid of the unknown. Don’t try to be a big fish in a big pond
before you’ve been a big fish in a small pond. Don’t start a company with
people you don’t really like. Don’t neglect sales and marketing.

And, my favorite bit of advice: Do not, under any circumstances, create a
complex or confused organization. “The best thing I did as a manager at
PayPal,” Thiel writes, “was to make every person in the company responsible
for doing just one thing. Every employee’s one thing was unique, and everyone
knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing.”

This, of course, is applicable to people in any organization or business
whatsoever, in the old economy as well as the new. I am constantly astonished
at how many big companies are so badly organized and how few follow sensible
management techniques. Maybe if more established companies adopted a little
more of the thinking of successful startups, there would be fewer successful
startups.
