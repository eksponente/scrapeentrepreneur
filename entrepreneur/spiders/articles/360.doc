Industrial Revolution

Jim Middlebrook, the founder and president of Vortech Engineering, was feeling
the squeeze of success. After founding his Oxnard, California, company in 1990
to develop performance parts and accessories for the automotive aftermarket,
by 1997, he'd revved up sales to more than $7 million.

But finding growth capital was still a problem. With the government taking a
large portion of a company's earnings right off the top and tooling costing a
pretty penny as well, Middlebrook says, "In the end, there's not a lot left to
make the company grow."

Middlebrook knew he needed growth capital to expand in his existing market and
enter the marine and industrial markets, but he avoided the usual sources,
such as venture capitalists and angel investors. "They want too much
involvement or too much equity--or both," says Middlebrook.

In early 1997, a commercial banker suggested Middlebrook consider an
Industrial Development Bond (IDB), which provides long-term financing at low
rates to manufacturing companies investing in fixed assets, such as land,
buildings and equipment. The banker put Middlebrook in touch with Dan
Bronfman, an IDB consultant and founder of Santa Monica, California, Growth
Capital Associates.

Bronfman says IDBs are largely misunderstood and underutilized because prior
to tax legislation in 1986, they were the province of large corporations,
which used them to finance manufacturing facilities, distribution centers and
retail outlets. Today, Bronfman says, IDBs--worth approximately $1.5 billion
annually nationwide--finance companies involved in manufacturing or value-
added processing that have sales between $5 million and $30 million and are
looking for net financing proceeds of $1.5 million to $8 million.
