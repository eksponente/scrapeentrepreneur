Cash In, Cash Out

In January, home product distributor Jeff Schreiber traveled to Dallas for a
trade show, a rare opportunity to meet with vendors in a deal-making
atmosphere. Schreiber, 30, negotiated a deal to purchase $40,000 in ceiling
fans from one of the manufacturers. Fortunately, the supplier agreed to give
him until July to pay for the goods. But he also made Schreiber an appealing
offer he couldn't refuse.

The vendor would give him a 3 percent discount for paying by May 1, and an
extra three-quarter-point reduction for each month he settled the account
before that. While a May payment would yield $1,200 in savings, Schreiber
would save another $600 by paying in February. Not only that, the early
shipment also gave Schreiber a jump-start on sales before any payment
deadline. It was a win-win scenario for [Hansen
Wholesale](http://www.hansenwholesale.com), his $3.5 million company in
Cerritos, California.

When a vendor dangles an attractive financial incentive, Schreiber rarely
passes, wracking up $15,000 in early-pay savings in the past year alone. Says
Schreiber, "Your money works better if you take advantage of the discounts."

**Do the Math**  
Schreiber is wise to be so vigilant about cash flow. Knowing how to maintain a
healthy cash flow is essential, yet entrepreneurs often overlook obvious ways
to improve their financial position, including how they manage payables. While
taking advantage of discounts reduces cash flow, savings go directly to a
company's bottom line. Cash-strapped companies, meanwhile, often don't bother
to negotiate extended payment terms.

Because businesses gain the greatest benefit from paying the invoice with
funds generated by selling units from an order, how they manage payables plays
a critical role in cash-flow management. In the best of worlds, a company can
sell an item before it has to pay for it, so the payment terms serve as an
interest-free loan.

It's quite common for a supplier to offer payment terms rather than requiring
money upfront. A typical term is "2/10, net 30." This means the entire balance
is due within 30 days of the invoice, but the buyer can deduct 2 percent if
the bill is paid within 10 days of the invoice date.

"For a company doing a million dollars a year in purchases, that translates
into $20,000 that flows to its bottom line," says Marty Weiss, counselor at
the San Diego chapter of the [Services Corps of Retired Executives](http://www
.score-sandiego.com). "If you have money in the bank, why would you throw away
the $20,000?"

Companies with restricted cash flow, on the other hand, need to take as long
as they can without incurring late fees or interest charges to pay bills.
Experts advise them to take the extra step of obtaining liberal payment terms
to carry them through slow selling periods. Because delayed payment terms are
costly to the supplier, business owners should be prepared to offer something
in return, such as buying a certain amount or displaying the vendor's product
more prominently, maintains Weiss.

Whether asking a vendor for extended payment terms or for an early-pay
discount, entrepreneurs have to assess whether a supplier's demands are
realistic. "If I was doing $4,000 in purchases a month and the vendor said 'I
want you to buy $40,000 worth of product, and I'm going to have [payment] due
in three equal installments,' that's not going to work," Weiss insists.

By the same token, it may not be practical for a business to increase purchase
volume as a condition of receiving better terms. Rather than easing cash-flow
burdens, it may tie up too much capital in stock, creating payment problems.
"[Paying late] is not an advisable way of improving cash flow," Weiss warns. A
supplier may ultimately require cash in advance or limit credit, stifling
business growth.

**Stand Your Ground**  
Vendor negotiations, even under the best of circumstances, are daunting.
Schreiber, who already had experience brokering vendor contracts, can see how
an aggressive sales agent could be intimidating. His advice: Be prepared to
walk away. "As soon as you're afraid to walk away, you lose leverage," he
says.

Before buying a product, Schreiber meets with at least three vendors, asking
each the same questions. "I leverage one vendor vs. the other. I say 'I'm
working with this vendor, and this is what they're going to give me; why
aren't you able to give me this?' They'll often bring up a point that I'm not
getting, and then you try to marry the best of everything into a final
proposal you send to all of them."

A business owner, Schreiber says, will have more power if he or she buys large
amounts from a small group of vendors. "You can leverage that better than
buying from a lot of vendors and spreading it around. You're a bigger fish."

While business owners may think to inquire about discounts for volume and
frequent-customer discounts, they shouldn't stop there, says Ray Silverstein,
founder of the Chicago-based [President's Resource
Organization](http://www.propres.com), a network of business owners.
Entrepreneurs may get a promotional discount, for example, by creating an
advertising plan for the vendor's product, such as featuring it in a catalog.
"Your imagination," he says, "is your only limitation."

Silverstein also recommends requesting "obsolescence money," which allows your
company to upgrade to an enhanced product at no additional cost, and striking
a deal to eliminate your need to return defective items to vendors. Another
option is asking for bulk packaging instead of paying more for individually
wrapped items.

Consignment financing, he says, also helps minimize cash flow going out of the
business. While the entrepreneur may plan to use a certain number of items
over a period of time, their need often varies. Vendors may let companies
place a standing order for the entire amount but will hold on to the product
until it's required, eliminating the need for businesses to carry the cost of
maintaining inventory.

Co-op advertising is another under-used strategy. It allows the retailer to
place an ad partially paid for by the manufacturer in return for mentioning
the product. A vendor may have a 5 percent co-op advertising program payable
on a fifty-fifty basis. In that arrangement, a $100,000 purchase would earn
the company $5,000 in advertising funds. If the entrepreneur purchased a
$1,000 advertisement, the vendor would contribute 50 percent, or $500, from
the account. "It increases cash flow with your vendor but has nothing to do
with invoices," Weiss says. "These are major differentials in your
profitability if you're doing real business."
