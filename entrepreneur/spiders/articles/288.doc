Take This Hand

If there's a credit squeeze on lending to small businesses, or if competition
for entrepreneurs' business has slackened, somebody forgot to tell the banks-
particularly the big ones. "Boy, I don't feel that," says Joan Gulley, CEO of
Business Banking for PNC Financial Services Group. "There might be pockets
here or there where someone has pulled back, but it's still a very competitive
environment."

So competitive, in fact, that big banks are falling over themselves to show
that the small-business market is a top priority. Pittsburgh-based PNC
recently announced plans to lend $12 billion to new and existing small-
business customers over the next three years, an increase of about 10 percent
per year. That announcement came on the heels of the bank's decision to
drastically cut back corporate lending to reduce risk.

Other banks have re-examined their corporate lending standards following an
increase in high-profile bankruptcies and credit problems among large
businesses. Indeed, in its most recent survey, the U.S. Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency found that 55 percent of the 65 largest national
banks say their loan standards are getting more rigid. But Jennifer Thompson,
senior vice president and bank analyst for Putnam Lovell Securities, says that
while banks have been more careful in terms of their underwriting criteria
over the past year and a half, small businesses have not been hurt
disproportionately.

At Boston-based FleetBoston Financial, for one, small-business customers are
looking much better relative to their big-business counterparts, says
executive vice president and manager of regional small-business banking Ralph
Sillari. Fleet saw an increase in small-business credit commitments of 30
percent in 2001 over 2000, and 15 percent growth in the first quarter 2002
over the same period in 2001. With some 500,000 small-business customers, the
bank also led the league in SBA-guaranteed loans, with the average loan at
about $60,000, in 2001. Says Sillari, "We are not thinking that this is a time
to pull back."

**No Small Matter**

While the lending itself does not represent major profit potential for banks,
the opportunity to cross-sell other small-business products-such as payroll
services, retirement plans and medical savings accounts-is huge, says
Thompson. Once it brings an entrepreneur on board, the bank can also go after
personal deposit and lending business-something that's not practical with
corporate customers.

That opportunity has not been lost on PNC, which regards lending as an entrÃ©e
into the total relationship with the entrepreneur. "[It's] a litmus test of
the relationship," says Gulley. If the bank can prove it's committed by
shelling out more in loans and credit, then it has a better chance of selling
its bread-and-butter products, including personal and business banking,
401(k), treasury management and brokerage services. To help support those
products, PNC has added 200 bankers in the last year and has designed call
centers dedicated to small-business banking.

Other banks have been beefing up their small-business offerings as well.
Citizens Financial Group, of Providence, Rhode Island, a subsidiary of the
Royal Bank of Scotland, recently announced it would add 500 jobs in its retail
and small-business units. KeyBank began a campaign in April to win new small-
business customers with incentives like free business checking for 12 months
and eligibility for additional savings on personal checking, Internet banking
and payroll processing. And Fleet is offering a bundle of products-including
200 monthly transactions, overdraft protection, online banking and bill
payment, and a credit card-for a fixed monthly price.

Gulley says PNC expects things to get better in terms of credit, as the
economy, which forced many entrepreneurs to pull back on plans for expanding
their businesses, improves. "We're looking at later this year and 2003 as an
opportunity where a lot of small businesses will be back thinking about
expanding," she says. "And our goal is an ever-increasing market share in this
business."
