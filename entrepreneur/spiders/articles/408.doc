When to Use Credit Cards

You need money--and fast. Is there ever a good time to use credit cards for
your business? There are many different perspectives on the subject, as well
as other options for obtaining smaller amounts of money in the short term. Of
course, credit cards aren't necessarily good or bad; it just depends on how
you use them.

As you probably know, there are times in business when you're low on cash and
have to decide the best way to get money quickly. Should you personally invest
in the business, get a loan from a bank or other third party, or use your
credit card? These are all viable and appropriate options, depending on the
situation. So let's explore the options.

Using personal funds can be the least costly approach, but you want to make
sure you don't drain your cash fund completely. If you use your personal
savings, you can account for this as a loan to the business or an equity
investment. As a loan, the business will pay you back the principal that you
loaned plus interest. In essence, you're lending to your business, and you
receive the interest income personally. The business gets to expense the
interest.

Borrowing funds from a third party is a very common option when you're
purchasing assets. Lenders tend to shy away from loaning money for operating
expenses because once the expenses are paid, there's nothing to show against
the liability on the balance sheet. You've increased your debt without an
accompanying asset.

Operating notes or lines of credit can be a smart option for established
businesses. Ideally, you should use these only short term when you need to pay
your bills today and won't receive payment from your customers for a short
time period. Lines of credit are not designed to be long-term loans; they are
revolving loans. That means you'll often advance and pay back the loan
frequently. Lines of credit are designed to cover the short term gaps between
cash inflows and outflows. Lines of credit tend to have higher interest rates
than your traditional term loans.

So if you're purchasing assets, your term loans are more ideal than lines of
credit. The interest you pay on either type of loan will be a tax-deductible
business expense.

Using credit cards can be advantageous when you're able to pay them off and
not incur the high rates of interest. Cards that offer cash back and travel
perks can be used for reducing future business expenses. The key is using the
cards responsibly and not carrying high balances. Credit card rates can be
quite high, and the finance charges can quickly get out of control. Ideally,
you should use credit cards for monthly expenses and then pay them off in full
at the end of the month. Carryover balances are what can get you in trouble.

However, credit cards companies will often offer incentives for short periods
of time that carry lower interest rates than traditional loan financing. Be on
the lookout for such opportunities.

The key is understanding the cost of borrowing the money and how it will
affect your business. Whether you borrow from a lender or a credit card
vendor, there's always a cost associated with using their funds. Before
choosing a method, determine if the benefits of using their money outweigh the
costs.
