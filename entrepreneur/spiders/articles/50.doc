C-Suite Women Serve Up Advice for Budding Entrepreneurs

Progress is being made as more and more [women taking seats in the
C-suite](http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/women-in-business). In 2013, women
held 14.6 percent of executive officer positions, a tiny spike from 14.3
percent in 2012, [according to
Catalyst](http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/2013-catalyst-census-fortune-500
-women-executive-officers-and-top-earners). Granted the rate of change is
slow, but at least it’s a shift in the right direction.

For me, it's been an exciting time to watch this evolution. I have had the
opportunity to work with some great women in leadership roles.

And these days Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is not the only woman in the
C-suite sharing advice. While her influential book _Lean In _offered advice to
encourage women to achieve their goals, other female executives have insights
for men and women on.topics ranging from management and business growth to
work-life balance and customer service.

I reached out to some women in the C-suite I know to gather advice they would
share with budding entrepreneurs. Here's what they wrote:

One essential tip is to bring a positive mindset when building a business.
Rolonda Watts, CEO of Los Angeles-based Watts Works Productions and a friend,
says to entrepreneurs of any age: “Be courageous, strong, and daring in your
risk-taking business venture. Replace fear with faith when challenged.” Adds
Watts, “Make work and play look and feel like the same thing. Do what you love
and love what you do.”

Next, be sure to keep a solid business plan. That includes knowing your
conditions of satisfaction and the things that you will do. Emily Constantini,
president of Encinitas, Calif.-based EMME, shared some wisdom that resulted
from her choices: “When I started [my] business, I made the [conscious]
decision to do three things: stay true to my vision for my product; collect
opinions and decide which are valid; and leverage resources for expertise
outside my own,” she says. (Disclosure: I sit on EMME's board.)

For entrepreneurs, mentors are increasingly important. Experienced mentors can
help guide a startup owner and mitigate the risks.

“Learning from other people’s mistakes prevents you from making them for
yourself and helps your business grow more quickly,” says Virginie Glaenzer,
executive vice president of marketing for New York City-based Great Eastern
Energy and a client of mine. “Write down the list of qualities and experiences
you’d like your mentor to have. Then, attend networking events and join online
communities to identify your ideal mentor and then simply ask them.”

Constance Freedman, managing director of Second Century Ventures who is vice
president of strategic investments for the National Association of Realtors,
echoes Glaenzer. “Validate your model and then find the best partners and
network to help you succeed. Don’t stop asking until you get the answer you
want to hear,” she says.

Whether the entrepreneur's office is on Main Street or Wall Street, he or she
will hear no frequently. Don’t give up after the first, second or even third
rejection. When one door closes, another opens, so keep at it.

Remain focused on goals. Jenna Woodul, executive and chief community officer
of San Jose, Calif.-based LiveWorld, recommends. “Even though your focus is
sharp -- and you’re passionate, directed, and believe you’re right -- remember
that business and competitive conditions change quickly; keep one foot up and
be ready to pivot.” (Disclosure: I sit on LiveWorld's board as well.)

“Look at your business frequently through both your binoculars and
microscope,” adds Heidi Lorenzen, chief marketing officer of San Francisco-
based Cloudwords and also a client[.](https://twitter.com/CloudwordsInc) “In a
small operation, the little things are the big things. Peer deep into your
business but don’t lose perspective by constantly focusing on details.” Step
back to take in the big picture on a regular basis, she advises.
