A common problem for small business owners is the struggle to maintain
adequate cash flow levels. Without cash, a business must eventually close its
doors. Understanding and managing your company's cash flow will help you
measure the amount of cash on hand and prepare for cash flow shortfalls in the
future.

**_In just 60-seconds_**_, we'll show you how to be vigilant about cash flow._

**0:60 Do the Math**  
Cash flow is the movement of money in and out of a business. Cash inflow is
the movement of money into your business, and most likely comes from the sale
of goods or services to your customers. Cash outflow is the movement of money
out of your business, and is generally the result of paying expenses. By
projecting the inflow and outflow of your businesses cash, you can determine
the amount of cash that will be available during a designated period of time.

**0:48 Prepare Your Profit and Loss Statement**  
Your business plan should contain several financial statements. If you're a
start-up business, base your estimates of cash inflow and outflow on the
revenues and expenses listed in your profit and loss statements. Complete your
profit and loss statement before completing your cash flow statement. Over
time, you will be able to base cash inflows and outflows on actual historical
data.

**0:30 Develop a Cash Flow Statement**  
A cash flow statement measures cash flow over time. During your first year in
business, you should include a month-by-month cash flow statement in your
business plan. If you're seeking a loan, an important feature of your cash
flow statement is that it will show the lender exactly how you're going to
afford loan payments.
