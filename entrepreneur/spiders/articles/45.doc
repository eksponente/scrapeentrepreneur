Get Over the Business-Naming Hump With These 5 Strategies

Naming a business is infinitely more difficult than naming a newborn.

At least, this has been my experience over the past few months, as I have
painstakingly labored over finding a name for a unique craft brewing startup.
While I have enlisted the help of a few incredibly talented entrepreneurs at
[Startup.SC](http://www.startup.sc), a new South Carolina business incubator,
and developed more possibilities than I care to remember, the arduous task of
settling on just one has caused me more than one restless night.

I know that I share this plight with other entrepreneurs.

There are [numerous resources for helping name a
business](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/21774). The problem for me has
been that, like most entrepreneurs, I have a long-term vision for a company
that has its own set of [naming
needs](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234845). Additionally, it seems
that almost every possible name has already been trademarked and every
possible URL has been purchased. For a while, these challenges caused it to
feel as though my creativity had been extinguished, and I was close to just
settling.

To get a little help, I spoke with [Nikolas
Contis](http://www.siegelgale.com/team_member/nikolas-contis-2-2/), global
director of naming at Siegel+Gale, a global branding firm specializing in
strategy, customer experience, brand identity, design and naming. Contis and
his naming team recently renamed the social incubator if(we). He provided me
with a great and insightful set of considerations for all entrepreneurs stuck
in this naming conundrum.

## 1. Consider your brand architecture.

Understanding how your business will brand itself is crucial. Ask yourself if
you plan on being a branded house (focus on the overall business brand, such
as Apple) or a house of brands (focus on branding individual products and
services, such as Procter and Gamble). It is difficult, risky and expensive to
do both. Understanding this will help guide your process.

## 2. Think about your long-term goal.

If you are chasing a long-term goal or technology, you do not want a name that
might ultimately become obsolete. Netflix is a great example. When Reed
Hastings originally named the company, his vision was to deliver movies
streamed over the Internet, not by DVD. The infrastructure and market,
however, were not ready. Regardless, his name reflected his long-term goal,
and the company eventually grew into it.

## 3. Do not chase trends.

As tempting as it may be to chase recent naming trends, such as substituting
"z" for "s," understand that trends change. Also, because language and lexicon
change ever faster these days, adopting a slang word or phrase is very risky.
You do not want to be stuck with a name that becomes irrelevant.

## 4. Do not rush to describe your business (completely).

There is an argument for having a name that is descriptive and educates
customers about what you do. While this might be important in some cases, more
important are names that stir emotions. Great names engage but do not declare,
and they evoke rather than explain. Instead of flat-out describing your
business, look to a name that prompts the customer to seek more information.

## 5. Do not be afraid to take a risk.

Along these lines, you really want a name that will get you, your staff and
your customers excited and talking about the business. Sometimes, this
requires getting a little more creative than you might be comfortable with.
Google recently named its Android 4.0 operating system "[Ice Cream
Sandwich](http://www.android.com/about/ice-cream-sandwich/)" (following its
previous operating system, "KitKat"). By doing so, it has literally changed
the way people talk about operating systems. You may not be able to get this
creative, but if your name gets everyone emotionally involved with your
business, it will help drive the conversation.

Contis was quick to point out that your business’s name is a creative platform
for telling a long-term story to the world, so it is worth spending some time
and effort into finding the best fit.

Also, it is crucial to put naming as a top priority, as your company name will
ultimately drive the culture of your startup and set the tone for everyone
involved. If you are of the mindset that your name can be changed down the
road, consider how much easier it will be and how much brand equity you can
retain if you start with the right name.

While expensive for some entrepreneurs, the cost of hiring a naming company
like Siegel+Gale can have a long-term return. With a great name, your company
may not need to spend as much to raise visibility, build its brand or attract
and retain talent. Even if you do not hire a naming company, Contis suggests
hiring trademark help, since nothing will deflate an exciting startup like a
[cease-and-desist
letter](http://www.entrepreneur.com/formnet/legalforms.html).

Naming a business does not have to be as difficult as naming your children,
but it should be given the same amount of effort. Hopefully, both pay off for
you in the long term.
