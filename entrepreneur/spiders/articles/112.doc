But to capture the metrics that will help your specific business, you need the

## 1\. Measure everything.

You should measure the financial health of your company and fiscal targets
should be in your employees’ daily purview, but view your business through
other metrical lenses as well.

To make metrics work for your business, track and analyze proximity to your
sales and marketing goals as well as monitor the health of your team culture,
employee satisfaction and trends developing in the market.

## 2\. Self-evaluate.

Some of the most enlightening metrics come from your evaluation of your own
performance and job satisfaction. It can be difficult to judge yourself
objectively but deep down you probably know how your weaknesses percolate into
your work. And as a leader, your honest self-assessment can encourage your
employees to do the same.

## 3\. Invest.

Having a thorough, company-wide approach to metrics costs money but view it as
a wise investment. Invest in people, technology and processes, the three key
pillars to metrics success. Give your employees the tools and the time to
engage with metrics, by distributing surveys, creating visible dashboards and
holding dedicated metrics meetings.

## **4\. Make metrics visible. **

The best way to connect every member of your team to the company's metrics in
a meaningful, regular way is to make them visible. At my company, each
department has an analytics dashboard and scorecard, which display high-level
goals and how the organization is performing on the specific tasks that
comprise them. Making metrics visible encourages transparency and can
dramatically increase motivation.

## 5\. Hold touch-point meetings.

Metrics are useless if they don’t lead to company adjustments and growth. My
organization hosts weekly touch-point meetings where the discussion is driven
by a focus on company metrics. These meetings help employees develop the habit
of responding regularly and directly to the company's metrics and using that
information while it’s still relevant.

## 6\. Use surveys.

Acquiring metrics on your company's culture doesn’t have to involve a complex
investigation. Distributing thoughtfully written surveys to your employees (or
clients, for that matter) can give clues about the satisfactions and
dissatisfactions of your team that you can use to develop improvements.

## 7\. Connect the whole team.

You can’t keep the metrics to yourself or share them only with other leaders
in your team. The optimal way for metrics to help a business is by providing
every team member with feedback about the company's performance. This way,
everyone will feel accountable for the business, more motivated to stay
involved and better able to make intelligent decisions.

By letting members of your whole team connect with metrics and invest quality
time into digesting the findings together, you can turn those little numbers
into progress. It’s all about establishing a rhythm of communicating about how
your company is doing and how that relates to operations. This is  important
not only for your employees but also for you as a leader.
