7 Terrible Naming Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make

Your company name will get used more and last longer than any other investment
you make in your business. It’s important that you get it right the first
time.

Here are some of the biggest naming mistakes I’ve seen entrepreneurs make and
why you should avoid them.

## **1\. You believe your domain name has to match your business name**.

Tesla doesn’t own the domain name Tesla.com. Do you think someone wanting to
buy a Tesla gives up if they go there and don’t find the website? Of course
not! They type “Tesla cars” into a search engine and find it in no time flat.
And they don’t even notice what the domain name is, which by the way is
TeslaMotors.com. If Tesla doesn’t have to have an exact match domain name,
neither do you.

## **2\. You spell your name “creatively.”**

This is by far the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make when naming their
company. The problem with having a name like Naymz, Takkle, Flickr, or
Speesees is that you will forever have to spell it when you say it, because it
isn’t spelled how people hear it. (Think about how often you have to spell
your own first and last name. Why would you want to have to do this with your
brand name, too?)

Plus, Siri and other voice recognition software do not understand names that
are not spelled naturally. And if you and your employees have to spell your
name out loud for people, you are wasting everyone’s time and apologizing for
it, over and over again. Resist the temptation of getting one of these domains
just because it’s available for $9.95.

## **3\. You use an obscure domain extension to spell your name.**

While it’s tempting to create a domain name using a country code such as .me
for Montenegro, .it for Italy, .us for United States, and .io for Indian Ocean
Territory, those names are tru.ly troubleso.me. In addition to being difficult
to spell, these domain names can be hard to pronounce, especially when unaided
by a visual identity. How do you pronounce Copio.us? Is it “Copio dot U-S” or
“Copious?” Equally troublesome is that the human eye is trained to stop when
it reads a period. So a name like Copio.us causes people to stop reading (for
all the wrong reasons).

## **4\. You business name is too niche.**

You don’t want to outgrow your business name. What if Amazon had been named
Bookstore.com? They would be limited to selling books.

One name that outgrew itself is Burlington Coat Factory. When they were naming
their store, they didn’t think far enough into the future. When they expanded
their product offering, they had to change their tagline to, “We’re more than
just coats.” (They also always have to have a legal disclaimer in their ads
that says, “Not affiliated with Burlington Industries.” Ouch.)

## **5\. Your name pronunciation is not ****güd.**

Your name should be approachable and intuitive to pronounce in your brand’s
country of origin. Don’t rely on punctuation marks or letters in different
colors to aid in pronunciation. Your name will not appear in color in the
press or in search-engine results and people go batty trying to find accent
marks and umlauts on their keyboard.

## **6\. You invent a clunky coined name.  **

If you invent a new “word” for your name, be careful that it doesn’t sound
unnatural. Mashing two words together or mixing up a bunch of letters to form
a new word rarely appears or sounds smooth. And be cautious using trendy
suffixes to make up a new word. Sprayology, Teaosophy and Perfumania are all
train wrecks.

## **7\. You try to be mysterious.**

A sure-fire way to annoy people is to choose a name that’s completely random
and seemingly meaningless. One I wonder about a lot is Vungle. I have no idea
what this company does, and I don't want to know. Likewise, can you guess what
companies Qdoba, Magoosh, Iggli, Kiip, Zippil, or Zumper do?

Blindly following naming trends will lead to nothing but trouble down the
road. But don’t just take my word for it. Ask the founders of Xobni, Svbtle,
and_ _del.icio.us.
