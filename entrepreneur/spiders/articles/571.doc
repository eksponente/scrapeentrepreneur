The New Risk Tolerance

**Here's a quick multiple-choice quiz for you: Where's the safest place to stash your cash?**  
  
**a)** Gold  
**b)** Treasuries  
**c)** An FDIC-insured checking account  
**d)** Your mattress  
  
If you picked A, B, C or D, you're probably losing money.  
  
Think about it: The price of gold can fluctuate 30 percent or more in a matter
of months--and has. Treasuries, while backed by the faith and credit of the
U.S. government, can rise or fall depending on interest rates and other
factors. And while it may help you sleep at night to park your cash in a bank
account (or under your mattress), it probably won't keep pace with inflation.  
  
Unfortunately, when it comes to investing, safety is a relative term. Who
could have imagined five years ago that a blue chip company like General
Motors would be in bankruptcy? And who could have predicted that states like
New York and California would have trouble balancing their budgets and paying
their bills?  
  
That's why even the most conservative money managers believe that the best way
to protect your cash is not to pull the covers over your head but to pursue a
cash-protection strategy that rewards you for taking a little risk.  
  
Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic Capital, a wealth
management firm in Chatham, N.J., has been advising his clients to adopt a
three-pronged strategy that includes CDs, high-quality corporate bonds and
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Not only does this strategy
give his clients access to immediate cash and a hedge against inflation, it
also lets them take advantage of the huge spread that now exists between
corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries.  
  
"If you invest in a corporate bond that pays 5 percent, even if you're in the
50 percent tax bracket, you're still ahead of the game," Cordaro says.  
  
And because Cordaro typically uses mutual funds to execute this strategy (as
opposed to investing in individual bonds), he's able to offer his clients
diversification across a variety of corporate issuers. This means that even if
one company defaults or files for bankruptcy, the effect on the rest of the
fund will be minimal. The downside to this approach is that mutual funds have
no fixed maturity date, and therefore may fluctuate in value. That's why it's
important to keep some of your money in cash, Cordaro says.  
  
Of course, no strategy lasts forever. When market conditions change, it may be
time to shift to Plan B.  
  
"The time to move on is when the spreads come down, when you're no longer
picking up a big incremental return over Treasuries," Cordaro says. "If we
ever got back to where we were in the early '80s, when you could buy a
30-year, zero-coupon Treasury bond paying north of 15 percent interest, I
would definitely stock up on those."
