The dream: running a successful business. The reality: taking responsibility
for all components of that business. While entrepreneurs eagerly tackle
marketing, sales, quality control, production levels, customer service and the
gamut of operating problems, most shun financial management. Accounting is
seen as a boring, indecipherable stepsister best left to outside experts. But
it needn't be boring or indecipherable. And it shouldn't be left to outsiders.

"Finance can be fun," says entrepreneur Suzanne Caplan, who encourages
business owners to understand that numbers tell a story. "When you learn how
to read that story, it gets far more interesting. After all, you probably went
into business because of your personal competitiveness. The numbers are how
you keep score."

If you simply glance at a month-end statement, you miss the details--gems of
information that could mean increased profits, future stability and effective
negotiations. Worse yet, you might fail to recognize negative trends or
imminent threats. A basic understanding of accounting and finance enables you
to use profit and loss statements, balance sheets and cash-flow reports as
tools to help set budgets, control costs, respond to aggressive competition
and adjust to economic downturns.

You don't have to be an accountant or even a bookkeeper to glean such insight,
"but you will want to know how the system works," suggests Caplan. A
turnaround specialist who has consulted small businesses for more than 20
years while operating her own small manufacturing firm, Caplan explains how
the system works in _Streetwise Finance & Accounting: How to Keep Your Books
and Manage Your Finances Without an MBA, a CPA, or a Ph.D_ (Adams Media Corp.,
$17.95, [www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com)). It's not light reading, but
it is illuminating. Biting off one chapter at a time, it's usually digestible.
The subject is addressed in clear and simple terms, introducing accounting
basics for the novice: how to set up a chart of accounts, accounts receivable
and accounts payable, i.e., what is cash basis vs. accrual basis, debits vs.
credits, fixed vs. variable cost?

While the first half of _Streetwise Finance & Accounting_ helps you understand
the origin of the numbers that go into income and expense accounts, how debits
and credits work and how they track, what a general ledger is and so on, the
second half details how you can put your newfound knowledge to use: how to
price products or services, how to finance growth, how to anticipate and
confront adversities and how to improve your bottom line.
