Credit Card Rewards

Entrepreneurs hail from hundreds of disparate cities, industries and
backgrounds, but one thing they have in common is an appreciation for plastic.
Paying by credit card is convenient, it allows business owners to maximize
their cash flow, and it offers the accumulation of rewards or points that can
add up to thousands in free services each year. For regularly recurring bills,
however, nothing beats the convenience of automatic bill payment, the kind
typically offered online through consumer and business checking accounts.

Now, paying recurring bills automatically by credit card, which offers the
best of both worlds, is catching on big with small businesses. Over the past
two years, New York City-based American Express has seen its charge volume for
automatic bill pay for small-business customers grow by 30 percent per year,
says Karen Rosenberg, vice president of OPEN from American Express, the
company's small-business unit. She sees it as a way to replace check-writing,
with added benefits. "It helps [business owners] consolidate spending on the
card and lets them better track and manage cash flow," she says.

American Express and its rivals, MasterCard and Visa, have all developed
sophisticated online reporting tools to enable users to keep track of expenses
and slice and dice them for budget purposes. Looking at a monthly or quarterly
statement, business owners can see how much they're spending on utilities or
subscriptions, or on over-night deliveries, says Doreen Amano, vice president
of global product development at MasterCard International in Purchase, New
York. "That can potentially help with negotiation with vendors when it comes
to rate reduction," she notes.

For Ava Seavey, president of [Avalanche Creative
Services](http://www.avalanchecreative.tv/), an advertising firm based in New
York City, convenience and the consolidation of expenses were key reasons to
sign up for automated bill payment with half a dozen recurring vendors.
Seavey's company employs only four full-time people but boasts several high-
profile clients, and she only has part-time financial help from her controller
and bookkeeper. "So anything I can do to save my time is worthwhile," says
Seavey, who uses American Express for most business expenses. "I find that
this minimizes the paperwork. Time is money, and writing checks costs money."

Then again, credit can cost money, too, if balances are allowed to slide. One
finance charge or late penalty can erase a month's benefits of card use, so
it's only worth doing if the balance is paid in full each month. In an effort
to minimize debt, many entrepreneurs are turning to debit or check cards
instead, which offer a lot of the same benefits.

"There's an overall concern about accumulated debt among small-business
owners," says Diana Knox, senior vice president of Visa USA in San Francisco.
She notes that business credit spending is up, but Visa has seen both business
credit and debit growing by double digits over the past few years. Business
owners can sign up for automatic bill pay with Visa and earn points or rewards
through the Visa check card, just as they would with a credit card. And
through its online reporting tool, Visa Information Source Select, launched
this past summer, entrepreneurs can view all their credit and signature-based
debit transaction information in one place.

For those who want to pay everything automatically on the same piece of
plastic, the wait will be a little bit longer. The list of merchants set up to
handle automatic bill payment is certainly growing, but it's only a fraction
of the vendors out there that business owners have to pay each month. "I don't
think too many landlords take [American Express]," quips Seavey. But if they
suddenly decide to start, she says she'd be happy to put the rent-and anything
else she could-on the card as well. "Of course," she adds, "they'd have to
extend my credit limit a little."
