Categorizing Your Investors

When raising money for your business, it makes good sense to categorize the
types of private investors you're pitching. This will not only increase your
success rate with fundraising, but it will allow you to develop a funding
strategy that's consistent with your business model. My column this month
outlines a method for categorizing private investors to help entrepreneurs
tailor their fundraising pitch.

####  Who Makes Private Investments?

After you've tapped your personal savings and maxed out your credit cards for
business capital, the next step is to consider attracting funding from outside
investors. Who are these investors? One of the most comprehensive studies on
this topic is the [Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor](http://www3.babson.edu/eship/publications/Global-Entrepreneurship-
Monitor.cfm) , which has surveyed more than 9,000 individuals to discover how
entrepreneurs raise money for their businesses. According to their yearly
study, the vast majority of private investments in startups comes from close
family (42 percent), relatives (10 percent) and friends (29 percent) of the
entrepreneur. Only 9 percent of private investments come from strangers, such
as professional angel investors and venture capital firms. (Additional sources
include work colleagues--6 percent--and other sources--4 percent.) Despite the
media hype about venture capital, it's still an option for very few
entrepreneurs.

####  Financial Risk vs. Emotional Risk

Investing is about risk. The risk that you'll lose your money or not earn a
decent return is the most obvious risk faced by private investors. But for
most entrepreneurs, raising money is about managing emotional risk in addition
to financial risk. It's a daunting task to approach your family, friends, work
colleagues or neighbors to ask for money. (See my previous column on how to
make the ["kitchen table pitch"](/money/financing/startupfinancingcolumnistash
eeshadvani/article75924.html) for detailed advice on how to raise money.)

But you can lower your risks if you understand how your investors' motives and
investment sophistication can impact the type of investment proposal you make
to them. And it's important to remember that if you approach multiple
investors, they'll have different motives and you'll want to tailor your
proposal to those different concerns. To begin, consider each potential
investor with regards to comfort for financial risk and emotional risk.

In the area of financial risk and familiarity with private investing, you need
to determine the answers to these questions:

  * Is the potential investor able to lose their investment in return for a chance for a significant upside? If so, their comfort with financial risk is high, and you can consider them savvy.
  * Does their enthusiasm for you or your idea overshadow their investing experience? If so, their comfort with financial risk is low, and you should consider them supportive.

In the area of emotional risk and concern about mixing money with
relationships:

  * Would the investor withhold their money if they thought it would damage a relationship? If so, their comfort level with emotional risk is low, so consider them worried.
  * Are they far enough removed that the emotional risk feels low? If so, their comfort level with emotional risk is high, and you can consider them distant.

Using your responses to these questions, place your investor in the quadrant
below that you think best fits their comfort level:

**Savvy & Worried**  
A savvy and worried investor will tolerate some financial risk--such as a
substantial investment in a risky business--as long as the emotional risk is
low. For example, your mother may have both the means and the will to help you
get your enterprise off the ground. While she would hate to lose her money,
she's really more concerned that the loan not hurt your relationship with her
or with other family members. Your primary job for this kind of investor is to
alleviate their concern that an investment would jeopardize their relationship
with you. One way to do this is to assure this investor that you intend to
formalize the investment like a business transaction with legally binding
documentation. In my experience with advising entrepreneurs on raising money,
formal documentation and a repayment plan are critical ingredients for
reducing the emotional risks of transactions between relatives and friends.

**Savvy & Distant**  
The savvy and distant investor will tolerate both financial risk and emotional
risk. For example, your neighbor is a serial entrepreneur and dabbles in angel
investing; he's known you since you were a kid and likes your business idea.
As long as you can make a professional pitch and offer a respectable return,
he'll be comfortable with the financial risk and won't think twice about the
emotional risk. In this case, your investment proposal should include a
[business plan](http://www.entrepreneur.com/businessplan/a-z/) and
professional investment terms.

**Supportive & Worried**  
A supportive and worried investor is enthusiastic about your idea and your
ability to follow through, but is nervous about both the financial and the
emotional risks. For example, your older brother wants to help but has kids
entering college and only limited resources to lend you. In addition, you
suspect he wouldn't make an investment if he thought it might jeopardize your
relationship. With this type of investor, first and foremost, you need to make
sure your request is within their means. Don't ask someone who supports you
for more than they can afford because the refusal will be painful for both of
you. This is also the type of individual who might offer you the investment on
a handshake. Without hurting their feelings, explain that you want this to be
a properly documented business transaction. You may need to remind them about
the tax benefits, legal benefits and credit-building benefits of formalizing
the investment.

**Supportive & Distant**  
A supportive and distant lender will want to avoid financial risk but can
tolerate emotional risk. For instance, a family friend of modest means loves
your idea and thinks you're a great manager. She expects to get her money
back, but the personal relationship is distant enough that she has no strong
sense of emotional risk. Take a guess at what this investor can afford, since
you may not know, but do be ready to negotiate up or down. This type of lender
will probably also benefit from a business-like explanation of the proposed
terms of the investment agreement.

Entrepreneurs rarely devote as much systematic thought and energy to
fundraising as they do to building their products and services (for good
reason). Given that more than 90 percent of all private investments are from
people you know rather than strangers, such as angel investors and venture
capital firms, I urge you to think strategically about categorizing private
investors so your fundraising pitches are successful.
