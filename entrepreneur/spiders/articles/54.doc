Soapy Sales

They say that necessity is the mother of invention. Sandie Ledray must have
thought about this when she started her Seattle-based business, Brookside Soap
Inc., dedicated to the creation of gentle, all-natural soap products. "I'm a
fair-skinned redhead, and had a lot of trouble with the products that were out
there," explains Ledray. "I wanted something natural."

When Ledray, now 37, found that many commercial soaps irritated her sensitive
skin, she began making her own soap and laundry detergent, both free from
synthetic materials and animal products. Today, her product line consists of
eight varieties of bar soap, such as Tangerine & Witch Hazel, Cinnamon Hand
Scrub, and Avocado & Calendula, as well as Best Friend Pet Shampoo, formulated
specifically for dogs and cats.

Ledray's soaps were an instant success even before she started Brookside in
1988. She started out making soap in her kitchen for her own personal use.
"Friends would go away with armloads of the stuff," recalls Ledray. Soon after
her acquaintances discovered Ledray's soaps, friend Mary McIsaac, now 51,
contributed half of the pair's initial $300 investment for a stainless steel
mixing kettle and the two basic ingredients needed for

hydroxide. When Brookside was incorporated in 1990, Ledray presented McIsaac
with half of the stock and made her vice president and co-owner.
