How Intangible Assets Affect Business Value

**Q:** I'm considering selling my business. Over the course of more than a decade, my business's name and logo have become well-known within the local community. How is this community awareness taken into consideration when pricing my business for sale?

**A:** Customer awareness and a prominent position within the marketplace are key ingredients to the success of many businesses, both small and large. The value placed on intangibles assets, such as people, knowledge, relationships and intellectual property, is now a greater proportion of the total value of most businesses than is the value of tangible assets, such as machinery and equipment. And the creation and management of intangible assets is often essential to long-term success.

A strong brand and a loyal customer base can be distinct assets owned by a
business or simply part of a business's goodwill. Examples of distinct
intangible assets include copyrights or trademarks that let a business sell
its products for a higher price or in greater quantity than its competition,
proprietary mailing lists of customers or prospects, long-term contracts, and
franchises with long track records and well-recognized names. Goodwill is
defined as the value of the business in excess of its owner's equity; examples
include a favorable location and community awareness.

As important as these assets are, most business owners do not have an adequate
understanding of how their brand and customer bases impact the value of their
businesses. Rule-of-thumb formulas do exist in some industries, but a better
estimate of value is gained through a more in-depth analysis. Brands can be
valued using three traditional valuation approaches: cost, market and income.

  * The cost (or cost of creation) approach relies on calculating what it would cost another business to duplicate a given asset today. This can be done using an estimation of current costs or by calculating the present value of all historical expenses of creating the brand.
  * The market approach focuses on past sale transactions of brand names. As expected, finding good data to use as a comparison is very difficult. However, if you're able to identify a brand that's comparable to your brand name and use it as a proxy, the market-based valuation analysis is quite reliable.
  * The income method measures the future benefits (such as sales, profits or cost savings) that the intangible asset will bring to a business, the timing of the receipt of those benefits and the length of time that the business will receive those benefits. Generally, a combination of a discounted cash-flow model and an excess earnings method is used to establish value under the income approach. A variation of this approach is to calculate and capitalize the profits generated by your business with the strong brand name that are in excess of a similar "unbranded" business.

In valuing your loyal customer base, it's important to remember the 80/20 rule
of thumb: that 20 percent of your customers most likely produce 80 percent of
your profits. Generally, the best method to valuing a customer base is to
segment your customers into categories based on characteristics that drive
profitability. For example, frequency and dollar amount of purchases or
longevity of relationship may be pertinent metrics. Using this data, a
lifetime customer value may be calculated as the present value result of the
average profit per purchase multiplied by the number of purchases per period
multiplied by the length of the relationship. This information will prove
useful not only in calculating a value for your customers, but also in
focusing your sales efforts on your most profitable customers.

A useful, though less-scientific, way to combine the analysis of your brand
and your customers is to consider customers' awareness, loyalty and quality
perception of your brand. Perceived quality has the strongest linkage to
strong profitability, usually because quality brands can demand a price
premium.

Customers' loyalty in purchasing is the number-one value-creating factor in
brand valuation because it results in an even and predictable revenue stream.
Loyalty can also be further categorized into non-customers, price-switchers,
passively loyal, fence-sitters and committed customer groups.

In the end, brand recognition and customer loyalty are very important
components of the value of your business. The realization of this value is
through increased earnings that are received steadily over a period of time.
You must understand this value, manage it in your business and convey that
understanding to potential buyers. The better you perform these tasks, the
higher a premium you'll receive for these intangible assets upon selling the
business.
