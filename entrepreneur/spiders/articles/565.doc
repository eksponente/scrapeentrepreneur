How to Not Get Fired

Here are a couple sentences you probably don't want to hear if you're the CEO
of a startup sharing a meal with your lead investor: "I don't think things are
working out. The board has decided that we need to replace you as CEO."  
  
Clearly, you needed to deal with things a long time ago.  
  
When things aren't going well in a startup, the pressure on the CEO can be
intense. Great CEOs open up in this situation, involve their investors
constructively in the context of the business and elicit their help. This
takes a lot of work in an already difficult situation, but it is critical to
prevent an all-or-nothing scenario where the CEO wakes up one day and realizes
he's lost the support of his investors.  
  
As an investor, I have a simple mantra about this: "I support the CEO until
the moment I don't. At that moment, it's my responsibility to address it."
Now, "address it" doesn't always mean fire the CEO; it can mean a range of
things that include getting back to a happy place where I once again support
the CEO. However, my approach isn't uniform. Some VCs are excellent at
expressing their concerns about performance; others aren't. The worst is the
passive-aggressive VC who is always agitating behind the scenes but never
willing or able to confront the CEO directly.  
  
But this isn't really about the VC--it's about the CEO. Regardless of
ownership percentages, the dynamics of your company change once you take VC
investment. In some situations, the entrepreneur maintains control over
whether he can continue to be the CEO--but this is atypical. In most VC-backed
companies, the board or a major investor can remove the CEO if they want. As a
result, it's the CEO's responsibility to make sure that the communication
lines are always open and clear.  
  
When confronted with this lunch conversation, the first thing a CEO should
find out is if this decision has been made, or if he is dealing with an
opinion by one of the investors. If the decision hasn't been made, the CEO
should take the discussion seriously, not be defensive and view it as a first
step toward either leaving the position or getting back the support of his
investors and board members. Like in any difficult situation, direct
communication always works better. The behavior of the CEO--in the moment--
will have a huge impact on the outcome.  
  
If the decision has been made, there are two approaches: Work with the
investors and the board on a smooth transition, or go down fighting. In my
more than 20 years of entrepreneurial experience, I can't think of a situation
where going down fighting resulted in a positive outcome for anyone. The
damage done to the company when everyone thrashes around is almost always
worse than sitting down and figuring out how to transition things as
gracefully as possible.  
  
Getting fired shouldn't be a surprise. CEOs of entrepreneurial companies
should be assertive about getting feedback from their investors on a regular
basis. Go to them; don't wait for them to come to you. In the same way that
you evaluate your direct reports on an annual basis, have the board evaluate
you on an annual basis. This will help prevent you from being surprised at
lunch one day.
