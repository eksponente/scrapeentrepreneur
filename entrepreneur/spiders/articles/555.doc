More on C Corporations

Last month's article about structuring one's business as a [C Corporation
versus a sole proprietorship](http://entrepreneur.com/money/taxcenter/taxperti
secolumnistbonnielee/article202620.html), an LLC, an S Corporation, or a
partnership generated the following letter from a reader:

Q:_ My wife and I make about $170,000 per year as salaried employees. My wife
is currently on severance for a year. She recently got a consulting gig and
the client will pay her $50,000 as an independent contractor. I was thinking
of setting up a C Corp in my wife's name and getting the check made to the
company. My question is that now that the checks are deposited into the
corporate account, should I make sure my wife gets paid from the corporate
account? I do not want her to be paid on a W2 anymore. Can I just let the
corporate account collect money and at the end of the year deduct my expenses
and file the federal and state tax on the profit I made? Vern N._

I guess Vern doesn't realize that he just pulled out a big red flag and is
briskly attempting to get the attention of the IRS. Sorry Vern, but unless the
corporation is broke and unless you have no intention of taking any pay from
the corporate accounts, you better find a way to pay wages to the working
principals. And I'm talking about wages--a paycheck, not a draw, not a loan,
not a dividend.  
  
First of all, it is very important to understand that when you set up your
business as a corporate structure, you are creating a strict environment in
which you will be conducting business. Aside from tax considerations, it's
important to know that corporations are formal entities with ritualistic
practices and covenants. Here are a few of the differences between a corporate
structure and the loosest business structure available, the sole
proprietorship:

  1. **A corporation** must hold board of director's meetings at least once a year. There is no similar requirement for any other legal form.
  2. **A corporation** must file separate income tax returns and pay corporate income taxes to the federal and state government (according to your state's requirements).
  3. **Corporate funds** can be withdrawn by the principals only in specific ways: dividends (which results in double taxation), wages, rents, loans but only if there is a signed note and repayment plan, otherwise the distribution may be reclassified as a dividend and taxes assessed to the recipient and the corporation.

Why is it important to understand these differences? Because, unless you cross
your T's and dot your I's, the IRS, or any litigant for that matter, can
"pierce the corporate veil" and turn your corporation back into a sole
proprietorship. This will expose your personal assets to lien and levy. In
other words, every tax purpose, every legal and personal purpose that drove
the formation of the corporation will be moot.  
  
To answer Vern's question, and reiterate what I touched on lightly in #3
above, make sure you are on payroll and take wages! And do so before you take
dividends or loans or other forms of payment from the corporation. The IRS
wants their fair share of employment taxes.  
  
The IRS is a savvy group. They are aware of the methods business owners use to
legitimately and illegitimately take money from corporate coffers without
inflicting payroll tax liabilities. And they are poised, ready to pounce on
anyone who bends the rules to the point of breaking.  
  
In fact, several years ago, the hot audit topic was corporate wages. And the
hot audit industry for said topic was attorneys. Audit staff became devoted to
reviewing records of Sub S Corporations who had declared exorbitant dividends
to their principals (taxable at modest income tax rates without the addition
of the dreaded and expensive self-employment tax) and at the same time paying
unreasonably low wages to said principals.  
  
The law firm and the attorney's loved this split--they save a bundle in taxes.  
  
But the IRS won't stand for it. "Yeah right. Mr. Hot Shot Attorney is taking
down $30k a year in wages and catching a $300k dividend in the mix. I don't
think so! We want payroll taxes!"  
  
Before deciding you would like to incorporate your business, make sure you
discuss all aspects with your attorney and tax pro. If you play fast and loose
with the corporate structure it will come back to haunt you.
