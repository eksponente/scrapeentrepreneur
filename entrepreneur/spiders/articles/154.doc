I had breakfast with two of my ex-students from Singapore who were building a
really interesting startup. They were deep into Customer Discovery and
presented a ton of customer data on the validity of their initial hypothesis –
target customers, pricing, stickiness, etc. I was unprepared for what they
said next. “We’re going to do a big launch of our product in three weeks.” I
almost dropped my coffee. “Wait a minute, what about the rest of [Customer
Development](http://steveblank.com/2009/09/17/the-path-of-warriors-and-
winners/)? Aren’t you going to validate your hypotheses by first getting some
customers?”

Without any sense of irony they said, “Oh, our investors convinced us to skip
that part, because our customer feedback was all over the map and our schedule
showed us launching in three weeks and they were worried that we’d run out of
cash. They told us to stay on schedule.” Now I was confused, and I asked,
“Well what do you guys believe – Customer Development or launch on a
schedule?” Without missing a beat they said, “Oh, we believe both are right.”

I realized I was listening to them treat Customer Development as an item on
their [To Do list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002V0AN2C?ie=UTF8&tag=www

Suddenly, I had a massive case of déjà vu.

## Can You Pull This Off?

I was VP of Marketing at Ardent, a supercomputer company where a year earlier
I had [a painful and permanent lesson](http://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-
out-of-my-building/) about Customer Discovery. I was smart, aggressive, young
and a very tactical marketer who really hadn’t a clue about what strategy
actually meant.

One day the CEO called me into his office and asked, “Steve I’ve been thinking
about this as our strategy going forward. What do you think?” And he proceeded
to lay out a fairly complex and innovative sales and marketing strategy for
our next 18 months. “Yeah, that sounds great,” I said. He nodded and then
offered up, “Well what do you think of this other strategy?” I listened
intently as he spun an equally complex alternative strategy. “Can you pull
both of these off?” he asked looking right at me. By the angelic look on his
face I should have known that I was being set up. I replied naively, “Sure,
I’ll get right on it.”

## Ambushed

Twenty-five years later I still remember what happened next. All of sudden the
air temperature in the room dropped by about 40 degrees. Out of nowhere the
CEO started screaming at me, “You stupid x?!x. These strategies are mutually
exclusive. Executing both of them would put us out of business. You don’t have
a clue about what the purpose of marketing is because all you are doing is
executing a series of tasks like they’re like a big To Do list. Without
understanding why you’re doing them, you’re dangerous as the VP of Marketing,
in fact you’re just a glorified head of marketing communications.”

I left in a daze, angry and confused. There was no doubt my boss was a jerk,
but unlike the other time I got my butt kicked, I didn’t immediately
understand the point. I was a great marketer. I was getting feedback from
customers, and I’d pass on every list of what customers wanted to engineering
and tell them that’s the features our customers needed. I could implement any
marketing plan sales handed to me regardless of how complex. In fact I was
implementing three different ones. Oh…hmm… perhaps I was missing something.

I was doing a lot of marketing “things” but why was I doing them? I had
approached my activities as simply as a task-list to get through. With my tail
between my legs I was left to ponder, What was the function of marketing in a
startup?

## Strategy is Not a To Do List, It Drives a To Do List

It took me awhile, but I began to realize that the strategic part of my job
was two-fold. First, (in today’s jargon) we were still searching for a
scalable and repeatable business model. My job was to test our hypotheses
about who were potential customers, what problems they had and what their
needs were. Second, when we found these customers, marketing’s job was to put
together the tactical marketing programs (ads, pr, tradeshows, white papers,
data sheets) to drive end-user demand into our direct sales channel and to
educate our channel about how to sell our product.

Once I understood the strategy, the To Do list became clear. It allowed me to
prioritize what I did, when I did it and instantly understand what would be
mutually exclusive.

## Good Luck and Thanks For the Fish

My students were going through the motions of Customer Development rather than
understanding the purpose behind it. It was trendy, they had read my book and
to them it was just another step on the list of things they had to do. They
had no deep understanding of why they were doing it. So they were at a
crossroads. Since their investors had asked them to launch now, what happened
if their initial assumptions were wrong?

As they left I hoped they would be really lucky.

## Lessons Learned

  * Entrepreneurs get lots of great advice.
  * Most of it is mutually exclusive.
  * Don’t do it if you can’t explain why you’re doing it.
  * Or else it all becomes a To Do list.
