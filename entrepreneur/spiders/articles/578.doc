In the Know?

Your CFO is having an affair with your office manager, and you're a little
concerned about what petty cash is being used for. No one in your company
wants to be in the same room as your CTO, and your vice president of
engineering has laid down the ultimatum: "Him or me." Worse still, you know
you're going to miss your revenue forecast for the quarter, but you have one
last chance to pull it off with an upgrade from your largest customer--the one
whose executive sponsor just quit and you don't know who's going to replace
her.  
  
Some entrepreneurs believe they should treat their VCs like mushrooms--keep
'em in the dark for their own good. But the best entrepreneurs view their VCs
as business partners and key advisors. The word transparency, while overused,
is a good starting point.

When to Share

**  
There are some vitals that you need to communicate to your VC no matter what,
including:  
  
. Fraud of any sort, or any suspicion of it  
  
. Credible threat of litigation  
  
. A fundamental concern about business or technology  
  
. A major issue with anyone on the management team  
  
. A major issue with any key partner or customer  
---  
Now, a VC doesn't ever want to hear the blow-by-blow of everything going on.
The daily ups and downs of being the CEO of an entrepreneurial company are
well documented; being an entrepreneur is an extreme sport. VCs are involved
in multiple companies, so the operational details of each are often too much
to process in any reasonable amount of time. And it's a huge burden on the CEO
to provide such detailed information on a near real-time basis.  
  
Also, each VC is different. Some only care about the financial details. Others
care more about the social elements of the business and the relationships
between team members. Yet another category of VCs cares mainly about customers
and competitors. The best VCs care about all of these things, including the
ongoing mental health of the CEO.  
  
As a VC, I don't ever want an entrepreneur or the CEO of a company I'm
involved in to withhold information about anything. At the same time, I don't
expect them to give me every detail about what's going on. Instead, I prefer a
culture of openness. Give me access to any of your management information
systems that I want; I'll probably use them often. Make sure your executive
team feels comfortable talking one-on-one with me; I assure you that I'll be
careful in my responses and won't undermine you. E-mail me regularly with
status updates and any information that you think will help me understand what
is going on in the business. Pick up the phone and call me whenever you're
really concerned about something (e.g., the stuff in the first paragraph),
fill me in, and ask me for my advice on how to approach the situation.  
  
The simple answer to the question "What shouldn't I share with my VC?" is
"nothing." But the converse isn't necessarily true, as "sharing everything" is
likely to be overwhelming to both you and your VC--and fundamentally
unproductive. Spend time understanding the best way to communicate with your
VC; we are an opinionated bunch and will usually tell you directly the best
way to interact with us. And remember to always shine a bright light on both
the good and the bad things going on in your business.
