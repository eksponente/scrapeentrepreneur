Paying Yourself: From Startup and Beyond

It's an age-old conundrum that faces every entrepreneur planning their
business: What do I pay myself? There are a lot of different theories when it
comes to this issue, but the two most common for startups are:

**1\. Pay yourself enough to get by.**   
At least during startup until you are operating in the black. The argument
here is to minimize your overhead in order to decrease the amount of capital
required to make your business a success. Also, by reducing your overhead,
your net loss will decrease or your net profit will increase, providing the
business with lean operating requirements until it is well established.

**2\. Pay yourself what you are worth.**   
Build that into your business plan so you have an accurate portrayal of how
much capital you will need in order to finance your business. By paying
yourself what you are worth, you aren't painting an artificial portrait of the
business that will change once you reach the black--operating costs will
remain the same.

So how do you know what is enough to get by and what you are worth? You have
to do some planning and simple mathematics, and then budget that amount into
your income and cash-flow projections so that you know how much operating
capital you will require during the formative stages of your company's
development.

What happens when you reach break-even and grow beyond that point? There are
many factors that go into the equation, such as legal form of operation and
tax requirements. You need to balance your needs against what you feel you are
worth, what you need to get by, what the business will be able to sustain, and
how your income as well as the business will be taxed.

Projecting Your Salary  
As we mentioned, there are two methods you can use to determine your pay
during startup. The first is paying yourself enough to meet basic living
requirements. Depending on your situation, that means enough income to cover
your bills, food and other miscellaneous living expenses. Strike all other
discretionary items from your life for a while and get used to just the bare
necessities. If you are used to dining at fine restaurants seven days a week,
get used to going down to the local McDonald's maybe once or twice a week.

To begin planning your pay, you need to put together your own personal
financial statement that lists all your living expenses and any credit cards
with outstanding balances as well as short-term and long-term loans. This may
be one of the most difficult things you've ever had to do because you don't
want to leave anything out. You want to make sure that your income from the
business will be enough to cover your expenses.

The _personal balance sheet_ should include a list of common items you'll need
to consider when determining your monthly living expenses. Generally, if you
can pay-down any debts before going into business, you'll not only decrease
the amount of income you'll require each month, but also improve your personal
net worth, which is important when it comes to borrowing capital to fund your
business.

Once you've listed amounts for each of the items on your monthly budget, add
them all together. This is the amount you will need to pay yourself in order
to meet your basic requirements. Remember when putting together your list to
include all your expenses. That doesn't mean just monthly, but quarterly,
semiannual and annual expenses. You must provide yourself with complete
information. After all, you will be living on this income for at least six
months to a year.

The other system from which you can project your salary is _basic worth_. How
much do you feel you are worth? That's a very subjective question. After all,
what you feel you are worth may not be what your value is on the market. Of
course, many people go into business for themselves because they want to
achieve a degree of financial security for themselves and their families.
Naturally, you're going to assume that you will pay yourself a basic minimum
of what your current market value is plus a little more. And that is exactly
how you will set up the equation to determine what your monthly draw will be
from the business.

To determine your basic worth, start by writing down your current salary or
hourly wage. That is what your market worth is at this point in time. This is
what you want to make at a minimum going into the business. But market worth
isn't basic worth. There is a difference. Basic worth is your market worth
plus a percentage increase based on three to four times the rate of inflation.

Why is there a percentage increase from market worth? As we mentioned, market
worth is a minimum, a starting point. It doesn't take into consideration the
increased responsibilities of running a business and your value to the
business as its owner. With these factors taken into consideration, your basic
worth is determined using the following equation:

_(MW ( 12) [1 (I ( 4) = BW_

In this equation, market worth (MW) is your total annual pay minus any bonuses
or overtime. Divide the annual market worth by 12 to get a monthly amount.
Then multiply this by the inflation percentage (I) multiplied by 4.

For instance, suppose you are making $15 per hour at your current job. At $15
per hour, your annual pay would be $31,200. Your annual pay of $31,200 would
then be divided by 12, resulting in a monthly income of $2,600. At the time
you are determining your basic worth, the rate of inflation is four percent.
Multiply four by four, and the percentage which you will add to your current
monthly income is 16 percent. Your basic worth would be $36,192 annually.

Of course, these are just recommended models to use when determining what you
will pay yourself during the period of startup to break even. You can use any
type of system you wish. The idea is to provide you with a realistic figure
that's fair and equitable.

Break-Even and Beyond  
Determining your salary during the planning stages of startup is important
because you need to include your income in the financial statements you will
produce in order to obtain financing for your business. Even if you are
financing the venture yourself, you need to have this information in front of
you; otherwise, your overhead won't be practical and any income, break-even
and cash-flow projections you will perform will be inaccurate.

Any bank or investor looking through your plan will check your financials very
carefully. They're going to look at these projections to make sure you can
repay the loan from the profits of the business. If they hold equity in the
business, they need to determine how great a return they can expect from their
investment. They're going to check the cash-flow projection to make sure you
have enough to cover your own draw and living expenses until the company is
profitable, unless, of course, you have a separate income.

Keep in mind that during the first year of business, it typically takes three
to six months to break even. Once you reach break-even, though, do you change
your salary? If you think you can, then you will make one of the most common
mistakes an entrepreneur can make.

Just because you've reached break-even, that doesn't mean your company is
profitable, or is even stable. If you're paying yourself just enough to get
by, raising your salary is going to increase your overhead, which will require
a greater amount of revenue from the business in order for expenses and income
to match. In other words, you've just thrown your business into the red again.
If you're paying yourself your basic worth, then you shouldn't need to raise
your salary, at least for a while.

After you've reached break-even, the best method to increase your pay is to
tie any income above your fixed salary to the growth of the business.
Therefore, if the company grows 10 percent during the first quarter after
break-even, take your base salary and add a 10 percent bonus to it.

Continuing with this example, if your base salary is $3,016 per month as
determined in our example of basic worth, you would multiply that number by
three (the number of months in a quarter) and add 10 percent. Therefore, you
have:

_(3,016 ( 3) ( 10 percent = $905_

You would give yourself a bonus of $905.

After your first full year in business, once you've passed break-even,
reevaluate your business to determine its annual growth and increase your
salary accordingly. As an example, suppose company sales have grown 50 percent
during the first year after break-even. Your current salary level is $36,192,
based on the basic worth example. Multiply that salary by 150 percent and you
will come up with your new annual pay, $54,288. You can retain the bonus
income after the first year of break-even if you like. After all, why not
compensate yourself for the increased performance of your company?

There are, of course, other factors you need to consider when determining pay.
For instance, what happens when the rest of overhead, excluding owner
compensation, grows faster than the rate of sales on a percentage basis? Most
of these expenses are required in order to operate your business. Sure, you
may be able to trim a little fat from the budget by removing any discretionary
purchases, but the fact remains that if overhead grows at 12 percent, and sale
grow 10 percent, it is only a matter of time before you find yourself in
trouble. By increasing your base salary by 10 percent, the rate of sales
growth, you are only hastening this crisis.

In order to keep your total overhead, including owner compensation, at a
comfortable level in relation to income, you will have to take that rise in
overhead into consideration when you determine your salary level. To do this
you need to determine how much your overhead is, excluding your salary. For
instance, suppose your annual overhead minus owner salary is $180,960, your
salary is $36,192, and sales are $312,000. If you add during the first year
after break-even, the company's sales grow by 10 percent of sales. Now, but
overhead minus owner salary grows by 12 percent to $202,675, or about 60
percent of total sales. Your raise in pay cannot exceed 70 percent, so you
will be unable to give yourself a 10-percent raise unless you want to cut into
your profit. Instead, you would give yourself a four-percent raise for a total
of $37,600 annually.

Keeping your costs under control means checking rapid growth of your overhead
costs. But no matter what you do, overhead will rise on annual basis due to
inflation alone. Your objective is to try and keep it in line with the growth
of sales.
