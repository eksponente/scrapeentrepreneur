What's standing between you and starting your own business? If it's a lack of

**_In just 60-seconds_**_, we'll show you how to build a sound financial foundation for your start-up business._

**0:60 Identify Your Needs**  
Estimate what you will need to launch and sustain your business-equipment and
supplies, inventory, office or manufacturing space, franchise fee, etc. Then,
consider what portion you can reasonably provide from your own resources
(e.g., savings, contributions from family or friends). Be careful. You don't
want to over or underestimate your needs, nor do you want to endanger your
family's financial security and relationships.

**0:48 Look at the Options**  
Commercial banks are the most visible lenders to small businesses, offering a
range of conventional loans, as well as [Small Business Administration

You can also look to venture capital firms, commercial finance companies,
partnerships, etc. Be sure to learn as much as you can about the evaluation
criteria and payback requirements for each.

**0:36 Build Your Case**  
Most lenders will require a business plan, a resume detailing your education
and practical business experience, a credit history with references and
specific loan documents. Develop your business plan with sections describing
the nature and type of your business, available resources and how they will be
used to meet specific goals, timelines, financial objectives, analysis of your
competition and how your business will fit in the marketplace.

**0:25 Fill in the Blanks**  
Lenders may also request cash flow projections that illustrate both the
viability of your start-up and your ability to repay the loan. Remember that
the data plan needs to be realistic and supported by facts to validate your
estimates and projections. Don't cut corners on research.

**0:13 Practice your Pitch**  
Every request for start-up financing will involve some sort of presentation.
Even if you're comfortable in these situations, organize your thoughts and
practice with people who will provide objective feedback. Fielding any and all
types of questions ahead of time will build your confidence and prepare you
for any issue that may arise.

**0:03 Ask Questions.and More Questions**  
Talk to your potential lenders about their processes and loan expectations.
