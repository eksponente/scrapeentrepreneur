Trimming The Fat

Before getting a good deal on office space from an out-of-business dotcom,
Earl Mollerud's office was on the third floor of a wing of a church. "It was
tough during the summer because they didn't have air conditioning, and during
the fall they were slow about turning on the heat," says the CEO and co-
founder of Kids' Hair Inc. in Minneapolis. But, he notes, the rent was a
saintly $500 per month.

Today, Mollerud, 40, cuts the cost of getting supplies to his 10 Kids' Hair
salons by ordering centrally and stocking consumables at headquarters. Each
Monday, managers return from sales meetings bearing a week's worth of hair-
cutting supplies. "Instead of having somebody drive around delivering," he
says, "they just take it back in their cars."

But Mollerud is no miser. In an industry where employee benefits of any kind
are rare, he offers stylists a company-paid health insurance plan. "And it's
the best one we can get," he adds. And while other stylists book appointments
in cheap paper planners, Kids' Hair has invested in a central computerized
appointment system that contains information on customers' personal hair
problems, preferred hair styles, frequency of visits and other grooming
concerns.

There's really no conflict between Mollerud's spending on some items and
pinching on others. He and entrepreneurs like him use a technique resembling
liposuction, a surgical procedure that removes fat from areas where it's not
needed or wanted, to target only certain costs for removal. Rather than
putting their entire organizations on stringent diets, they siphon off only
costs that add no value. In the process, they say, their profits grow, their
companies get stronger, and their understanding of their businesses increases.
