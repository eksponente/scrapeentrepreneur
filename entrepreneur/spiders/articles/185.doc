Lease Is More

_Business Start-Ups_ magazine, January 1998

Short on capital but long on equipment needs? Consider leasing instead of
buying. Leasing frees up capital because it eliminates the large cash outlays
and down payments required when purchasing or financing equipment.

"The smart way to obtain equipment is to borrow capital from a bank because it
costs less to repay the loan and you ultimately own the equipment," says Carl
Evans, who, with his wife, Norma, owns and operates Santa Fe Printing, a full-
service print shop in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Unfortunately, you might not have
that option. Because the Evans didn't qualify for a bank loan when they needed
$18,500 for a new printing press, they leased the new press at $550 per month
for four years.

"Leasing is more expensive in the long run," says Carl. "You pay for use of
the equipment; you pay for depreciation; you pay interest."

It may be your only choice, however. If so, negotiate every clause to get the
best deal you can before you sign a lease, says Carl, a former PIP Printing
franchisee. "Lease terms are not written in stone until you sign," he says.
"Study the contract carefully to verify the term of the agreement, renewal
options, equipment value, payment amounts, cancellation penalties and what
happens to the equipment at the end of the lease."

Whatever you lease for your business is deductible as an operating expense
(though an outright purchase may prove more beneficial, taxwise). Leasing
makes it possible to acquire needed equipment--anything from copiers and
office furniture to vehicles and heavy machinery--when you can't otherwise
afford it, while keeping your balance sheet healthy.
