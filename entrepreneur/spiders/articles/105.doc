run a successful wholesale distribution business. In this edited excerpt, the
authors discuss the factors you need to take into consideration when deciding
where to locate your new wholesale distribution business._

When it comes to distribution, the old adage “location, location, location”
holds true in some cases but certainly doesn’t apply across the board. And
while it's quite possible to start a small wholesale distribution business
from just about anywhere, entrepreneurs who want to grow and prosper must at
least be situated near transportation centers, especially if they plan to
utilize shipping methods other than local delivery. Several other factors also
come into play, so read on to learn exactly what steps you’ll need to take to
secure the right location for your company.

Wholesale distributorships usually don't require high-traffic or high-
visibility locations, but those that aren’t homebased would be wise to find
commercial space somewhere in the industrial section of town. Distributors
should seek out areas that are rich in industry and close to transportation
centers—especially if they're going to be shipping outside a 50-mile radius of
their locations (this is the “normal” delivery area for most distributors,
though the radius varies by company).

According to industry expert Adam Fein of Pembroke Consulting, desirable
locations also vary by the type of product being distributed. “If you’re an
industrial distributor, for example, you’ll want to be set up where the U.S.
industrial base is, typically in the Midwestern states like Ohio, Michigan,
Missouri, etc.,” Fein advises. “Generally, however, wholesale distribution
companies tend to locate where land isn't too expensive and where they can buy
or rent affordable warehouse space for the storage of inventory.”

Naturally, not every distributor needs a 40,000-square-foot warehouse situated
in a major industrial park. In fact, location may not be a critical issue for
the small wholesale distributorship that customers rarely visit. However, any
distributor who plans to sell “over the counter” to customers—or have a walk-
in showroom of some sort—would be wise to put some thought into his or her
location. If your company is a construction supply distributor that serves
building or electrical contractors, for example, your location should be
accessible to those customers as they go about their daily routines. The
location of your business should be decided based on both accessibility and
visibility (for the customer) and affordability (for the company itself).

Be sure to check out your county or city zoning laws before getting into a
lease or purchasing a building—you don’t want to find out too late that the
location wasn’t zoned for your type of business.

Study your target market, and make sure your location of choice fully meets
your clients’ needs. For some companies, that means setting up shop in a high-
foot traffic area. For others, it means positioning their locations near
public transportation. It can take time to find the perfect location for your
business, so get an early start and don’t give up.

Mike Smeaton of the Safety Market Group, a buying group of 50 independent
safety equipment distributors in Brooksville, Florida, says a new
distributor’s location is best determined by available, affordable warehouse
space that has adequate logistic support (such as UPS and FedEx) and available
skilled employees. “Most wholesale distributors aren't retail-oriented,"
Smeaton says, "so foot traffic isn't as important as square footage cost.”

One other thing to keep in mind: Because you’ll most likely be delivering
products to your customers as opposed to having them come to you (though some
distributors do have walk-up counters and storefronts), the average customer
won’t really care about where that product is stored. For this reason, using
your basement, garage or spare bedroom as a starting point in business can
make perfect sense, as long as you're situated near transportation hubs where
products can be shipped and received on a frequent basis.

Of course, what you're selling will also determine if you can start from home.
For instance, while a garage could certainly warehouse a jewelry or gift
business, if you’re selling heavy equipment, you’ll probably need more
“official” space for your operations.

**Lease, Rent or Buy?**

If you decide to set up your company in a commercial location, you’ll have
three choices: lease space, rent space, or buy the building. For the most
part, your decision will be between leasing and buying because, quite frankly,
the owners will want you to occupy the space for at least a few years (renting
is more of a short-term option). This can pose a problem for you in the very
early stages, namely because you're never quite sure how quickly your business
will—or, in some cases, will not—grow.

Don Mikovch, president of Alexandria, Virginia-based Borvin Beverage,
recommends that all new wholesale distributors lease space whenever possible.
“After all, you just need a flat-floor warehouse," he explains. "It’s not like
a meat-processing plant, where they have to have equipment like pulleys
installed in the ceiling in order to operate properly.”

Other distributors may feel differently. If the capital is available, for
example, it may be smarter to go ahead and purchase the facilities. Don’t
forget to factor future value into your decision. For instance, if you want to
be near a planned shopping center or close to a place where two highways meet,
you may realize that those areas can become much more valuable and that rents
might eventually go up. However, if you own the building from the outset, then
you don’t have to worry about it, and it becomes an asset for your business.

These days, location is becoming less of an issue for entrepreneurs looking to
start a business. As the Internet has broken down barriers between large and
small companies, and as professional voice mail services, marketing materials
and other tools formerly for highly capitalized firms become easy to acquire
on a small budget, it’s easier than ever to start a business from a spare
bedroom. The average wholesale distribution firm can be started anywhere, as
long as there are manufacturers to buy from and customers to sell to.
