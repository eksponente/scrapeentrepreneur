The Hidden Pain of Being an Entrepreneur

Last week, I got a call from a friend of mine who's an entrepreneur that was
probably one of the hardest calls he's ever had to make. He was calling to
tell me that he hadn't raised a dime for his fledgling company in six months,
hadn't taken a salary in almost a year and was about to miss his mortgage
payment on his house for the third month in a row (after three, the banks tend
to begin the foreclosure process).

His call got me thinking about how many more entrepreneurs out there were in
exactly the same boat he was in but just either (a) couldn't bring themselves
to make the call or (b) were still in a stage of denial where they didn't know
their ship was sinking.

Now if this were some first-time, twentysomething entrepreneur, you'd probably
think that 90 percent of the reason he was in this mess was a combination of
naivety, lack of experience and/or youthful brashness. What was so
particularly disturbing to me was this friend of mine was a mature,
experienced executive who'd "been there, done that" many times before. How
could someone like that get into such a hole? As if he'd anticipated my
question, he volunteered, "At every step, it seemed as if I were making the
right decision."

If you've ever had an entrepreneurial failure, I'd bet you can relate to his
comment. No one becomes an entrepreneur to fail. From the time we have our
"great vision" until the time we finally decide to take the leap and try and
make it happen, we do so with the absolute expectation that we'll succeed.

But as the saying goes, "If it were easy, everybody would be doing it," and
for many entrepreneurs, that soon becomes a personal reality. With few
exceptions, every entrepreneur must struggle through some very dark and
difficult times before eventually, if their luck matches their determination,
pulling out a winner.

Unfortunately, for every one who succeeds, there are far more who don't. For
them, their hidden pain is both complex and deeply personal. But they share
some common concerns:

**The Doubt Demons**  
"Dare I tell anyone of my doubts? If I show my doubt, will all my supporters
crumble with me?" You have no idea how much pressure this one thought alone
can place on an entrepreneur. On the one hand, history may show that an
absolute irrational belief by the visionary entrepreneur may be the only thing
that leads some companies to success. On the other hand, it's also the main
cause of many a company's failure. _So how do you know if you're the cure or
the disease?_

**Fear of Disappointing Investors**  
For most entrepreneurs, once you've experienced that magical moment of someone
demonstrating their belief in you by writing a check, you'll practically die
before letting them down. Some entrepreneurs complicate this feeling because
they've gone back to their investors more than once to get some help to get
though a crisis, and each time, the mental hole they dig that obligates them
to succeed gets deeper. _How do you know when the best thing you can do for
your investors is to quit?_

**Never Quit Too Soon**  
"What if I quit the day _before_ something big finally breaks for us?" History
is full of stories about entrepreneurs who were going to quit the day _after_
something big happened, and of course, that event changed the outcome.
Naturally, this attitude is further complicated by the basic feeling that
quitting is never an option anyway. _So when is the right time to quit?_

**Killing a Dream is Hard**  
To an entrepreneur, quitting is the fundamental equivalent of committing
suicide--when you kill your dream; you're killing a part of yourself.
Therefore, it's extremely hard for an entrepreneur to make this decision on
their own. Generally, they need help from advisors they actually talk to and
who'll help them decide exactly when there's nothing more that can be done to
keep the dream alive. Preferably, these advisors need to be people of
influence, like board members, shareholders and/or fellow team members, so
they'll have the option to use leverage (if necessary) to force you to see the
light. _Just when should you consult these people and take their advice, no
matter what it is?_

**The Question of "What's Next?"**  
Sometimes it's easier to deal with the devil you know than with the devil you
don't. The longer an entrepreneur has been involved with pursuing his or her
dream, the harder it is to extricate themselves from the muck. It's a bit like
a stunt pilot taking a plane into a power dive straight toward the ground.
There's a point where, if you don't pull up, no amount of effort after that
point will keep you from crashing. Entrepreneurs do worry about their
situation. But at some point in their cycle, if they end up doing it too long
without success, they tend to struggle with the following thought demons:

  * _Where do I go from here?_
  * _Entrepreneurial tendencies are neither valued nor wanted in corporate America._
  * _Who will want to hire a seasoned but older, failed entrepreneur?_
  * _Since I've drained every once of cash from my savings and borrowed from everyone I know, how would I survive during the time it would take to find another job?_

If you're reading this article and you know an entrepreneur who hasn't yet
grabbed their brass ring, you might just tell them that you feel their pain
and encourage them to open up.

On the other hand, if you are an entrepreneur and any of this comes way too
close to where you are or how you're feeling, call someone you respect and
give them an earful about what you're feeling. At best, it may just give you
the energy and/or perspective you need to turn things around. At worse, you
may just feel better knowing you're not alone and that there's a way out.
