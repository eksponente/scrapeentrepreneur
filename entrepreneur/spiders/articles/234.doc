Choosing a Finder When Raising Capital

If there's one thing entrepreneurs hate, it's having to ask others to invest
in their company. It takes time; it's embarrassing and sometimes humiliating;
it defocuses them from running their business; and, for most, it's not a skill
set they're blessed with. Successful fundraising requires:

  * Great writing skills
  * Superb salesmanship
  * A gold-plated rolodex
  * Excellent closing skills
  * Patience and persistence

Let's face it, the typical small-business owner is often lacking in most of
these talents. So when the need for some serious cash to accelerate your
business arises, what do you do? Generally, the first thing everyone does is
to try raising the cash on your own. But you can only take so many unreturned
phone calls, missed appointments, broken promises, lies and pure, out-and-out
rejections.

At some point, you may be tempted to hire a professional "finder."
Technically, a finder is someone who purports to be an expert at helping
entrepreneurs find money (or rather the sources that will invest the money).
Finders have a mixed reputation in the industry because they're substantially
unregulated and have a history of overpromising and underdelivering.

So what exactly do finder's offer? What do they charge? And how can you tell a
good one from a bad one? The answers are not all that clear. First, the value
proposition is quite simple--they'll help you find money. If your cash is
running low, this can be a most tempting offer, especially if you're
desperate. And herein lies the first caution: Be wary of seeking a finder when
you're desperate. You'll most likely make the wrong decision and pay dearly
for it.

The SEC, which regulates money-raising activities, sees a finder as someone
who's acting as a promoter of the sale of securities and thus is required to
have a Broker Dealer license. If they don't, then (a) they're acting illegally
and (b) any contract they sign with you is unenforceable--and therefore any
portion of their fee that's based on a percentage of the money raised isn't
collectable.

Some finders try to get around this by structuring their fees to appear as if
they're all about consulting. Others just ignore the law and take their
chances. Here's the first problem: There are some very good, unlicensed
finders out there. Being licensed adds a huge expense and regulatory burden
that many finders would prefer to avoid. So when you're on the hunt, the first
questions you need to ask are:

  1. Are you licensed? If not, why not?
  2. What's your track record of success?
  3. How do you collect your fees if you're not licensed?

The next area of concern should be in how the finder charges for their
service. Generally, finders will want a retainer fee plus a success fee paid
if and when they raise the money. Now, if the finder is good, such a structure
isn't a problem. But here's where this group earns their poor reputation. The
non-principled finder charges a retainer fee because they know it's the only
money they'll be able to collect. The principled finder will charge a retainer
fee both as an indication of the entrepreneur's commitment to the process and
because it will take some digging before they can determine if the deal is
fundable. If the deal turns out to have holes, they want to be compensated for
their time. In exchange, the entrepreneur will know why, in the finder's
opinion, the deal isn't fundable at this time.

Typically, a finder will charge a modest retainer of $2,500 to $5,000 a month
for a pre-set period of 3 to 4 months. Their success fee can range from a low
of 4 percent of the total amount money raised to a high of 10 percent. If they
never raise the money, they never get paid any more than their retainer. Some
will credit their retainer against the success fee, but that only helps if the
goal is reached.

When negotiating fees with a finder, it's important to ask the following
questions:

  1. Exactly what fee will I be charged? Will it vary depending on how much money is raised?
  2. How will the fee be paid--that is, how much in cash and how much in stock? If there's stock involved, at what price/share?
  3. If someone else helps me find the same investor, how will you split your fees?
  4. If the investor refuses to pay your fee, what do we do?
  5. What guarantee can you provide of funding? (If the finder is willing to provide a guarantee, ask to see their checkbook or run in the opposite direction.)

If you're an entrepreneur looking for capital, take the time to ask the right
questions and do your homework before hiring any finder. I can assure you that
your extra work will pay off in the end.
