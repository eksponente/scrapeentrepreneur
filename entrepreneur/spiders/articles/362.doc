Where the Funds Are

Getting a business out of the starting blocks can be daunting for a first-time
entrepreneur. From choosing a location to hiring your first employee, the list
of important considerations seems endless. But unless you're independently
wealthy, one looming thought will override all the others: Where am I going to
find the money?

Billions of dollars are available to businesses-start-ups included-from a
variety of lenders and investors nationwide. You've got to be diligent and
you've got to be flexible. But entrepreneurs committed to getting their
businesses off the ground will find the necessary financing, experts contend,
if they investigate and are open to all options.

In this high-tech age, those options are broader than ever. The Internet alone
provides access to funding through venture capitalists, finance companies,
banks, brokers, angel investors and mortgage firms. Then there are insurance
companies, leasing companies, the Small Business Administration (SBA),
community development agencies, franchisors (for those buying franchises) and
more. Before surfing the Web or plunging into unknown waters, however,
entrepreneurs should look closer to home.

#### Inside Sources

"Internal funds are by far the most important source for a start-up," says
finance and economics professor Glenn Hubbard of Columbia Business School in
New York City. Indeed, business owners often use personal savings, liquidated
investments, pension funds and even consumer loans.

Consumer loans are generally secured by using assets as collateral, and homes
are perhaps the most common assets used by start-up entrepreneurs. Putting up
your home for collateral allows you to refinance an existing mortgage (perhaps
at a better rate than you're currently paying), get a second mortgage or
secure a home equity loan or line of credit. Be reminded, however, you may
lose your home if your business fails and you default on the loan. As an
option, consider pledging other assets as collateral, such as real estate,
life insurance policies, business equipment and furnishings.

Other inside funding sources available to entrepreneurs include family,
friends and business associates. Usually private and informal in nature, loans
from sources close to you feature favorable terms without the need to pledge
assets. On the other hand, such loans can lead to problems which may threaten
long-term personal relationships and even your business. To avoid these
problems, put all loan arrangements in writing-no matter how close you and
your benefactor are. Don't forget to draft a formal agreement that stipulates
all terms, clearly indicating that the money is a loan and doesn't impart any
control or ownership of the business.
