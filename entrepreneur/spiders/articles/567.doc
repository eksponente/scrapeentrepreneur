Wait a Minute!

There is no such thing as a perfect elevator pitch. What works for one type of
investor may not work for another. An economic downturn, when capital sources
are limited, is a good time to take a look at your approach and apply these
enhancements.  
  
Choose your words carefully. You may only have 30 seconds to make an
impression. Saying "I've started a business to sell productivity software to
technology companies, and the business is doing well" might be a turnoff. Try
this: "I've been working to create proprietary software that helps tech
companies improve productivity, and the company is scaling rapidly." Using
words like "proprietary" and "scale" help the pitch reflect the desires of
investors.  
  
Practice your pitch with those not in the know. Even with some edited
phrasing, your pitch may still need refinement-and in fact, too much
wordsmithing can make you sound like a commercial with buzzwords and industry
jargon. Test your pitch with friends, relatives and fellow entrepreneurs who
know nothing about your industry. Be sure to ask for honest feedback.  
  
Focus on the follow-up The goal of your elevator pitch is to stimulate enough
interest for a follow-up meeting, but you should also try to determine the
focus of the investor. One way to do this is to end your pitch with a
question. Try "Do you have any investments that are thriving during the
downturn?" rather than "Does my business sound like a good fit for your firm?"
Even humble investors cannot resist the temptation to tell war stories about
their favorite deals. This can be an ideal opening to suggest a follow-up
meeting or, at the very least, suggest an exchange of business cards.  
  
Until you have a proper discussion, you won't really know if the investor is a
good fit or can refer you to a colleague who would be a good fit for your
business. Still, a strong and well-executed elevator pitch is often the first
step toward finding that out.
