Feel Safe When Filing Online

In 2006, some 73 million people--more than half of all individual taxpayers--
filed their federal taxes electronically. At the state level, 13 states now
require tax preparers to e-file, and 38 states allow combined federal-state
e-filing.

IRS and state e-filing is more secure than giving a retailer your credit card,
says Chuck Petz, vice president of tax software development at Petz
Enterprises Inc. in Tracy, California, which operates e-filing site
[Taxbrain.com](http://www.taxbrain.com/). The advantages of e-filing:

**It's easy.** Most filers or tax preparers fill out tax forms online anyway, so just press "send." Petz suggests mailing in your signature, though.

**It's accurate.** Electronic filing means fewer mistakes. Mailed-in returns have to be hand-keyed into computers by IRS workers, making the error rate higher.

**It's fast.** The IRS usually sends an e-mail receipt within 48 hours. And e-filers generally get their refunds in two weeks, direct-deposited into their bank accounts.

**It's safe.** IRS e-filing is highly secure, but to avoid scams, make sure you know the rules. Use IRS-approved e-file tax software or preparers. Remember, IRS and state tax agencies will never use e-mail to request account or Social Security numbers or other personal information.

For business owners, everything from W-2 forms to estimated quarterly tax
payments can be filed online. See [www.irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov/) for
details.
