Entrepreneurship Doesn't Cause Per-Capita Income Growth

Policymakers often look to entrepreneurship as a way to boost the income of
their residents, [proposing policies](http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-
do/resources/entrepreneurship-policy-digest/entrepreneurships-role-in-
economic-development) designed to stimulate entrepreneurial activity. While
different elected officials make subtly different arguments, at the most basic
level, their common position is this: boosting the rate of business formation
will cause the economy to grow and per capita income to rise.

Unfortunately, those in the business of formulating economic-development
policies have misunderstood the relationship between entrepreneurship and
societal wealth.  Rates of entrepreneurship are more likely to be the effect
of societal wealth than the cause.  Moreover, the relationship between per
capita income and entrepreneurial activity is generally negative, rather than
positive, as is often believed.

The Gallup Organization [shows the pattern
clearly](http://www.gallup.com/poll/175292/nearly-three-workers-worldwide-
self-employed.aspx) in a figure I have reproduced below. Analysts at the
research organization compared per capita gross domestic product (GDP) with
the fraction of the population that reported being self-employed in each of
135 countries. As Gallup’s picture clearly shows, the fraction of the
population that is self-employed has a negative linear relationship with the
log of GDP per capita.  That is, self-employment rates are lower in rich
countries than in poor ones.

Gallup’s study isn’t the only one to indicate a negative relationship between
rates of entrepreneurship and levels of per capita income.  Data from the U.S.
Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis show a similar pattern.  Between
1977 and 2011, real per capita income increased 79 percent in the United
States. Over the same period, the number of new employer businesses founded
each year declined 49 percent.  That is, as the United States has become
wealthier, the rate at which people have started companies in this country has
declined.

Several academic studies have documented the negative correlation over time
between the growth of inflation-adjusted gross national product and self-
employment in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries. These studies show that as the nations have experienced economic
growth, their rates of self-employment have declined.

Other studies show a negative correlation between rates of business formation
and economic growth across metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the United
States.  Those MSAs that have experienced more economic growth in recent years
have also experienced lower rates of new business formation than those MSAs
that have seen less economic expansion.

Rates of entrepreneurship are negatively related to growth in societal wealth
because rising incomes make possible more lucrative employment opportunities
than running one’s own business.  In poorer places, where fewer high-paying
jobs working for someone else exist, many people turn to entrepreneurship to
earn a living.  Statistically, this pattern means we see in a higher fraction
of people working for themselves in poorer places.

Similarly, over time, places tend to get richer as they experience economic
growth.  Rising incomes lead high-paying jobs to emerge in many places.  The
development of more lucrative alternatives to running one’s own business leads
many people to transition from self-employment to wage employment, driving
down the rate of entrepreneurship.

Gallup’s recent analysis and the many studies that have preceded it present a
cautionary tale for policymakers who want to believe that entrepreneurship is
a silver bullet to raise incomes and transform economies.  The data show that
rates of entrepreneurship are negatively correlated with wealth because richer
places offer people more attractive employment options than running their own
businesses.
