Value Chain Financing

Many entrepreneurs believe the only way to fund a new venture is through
traditional loans (e.g., banks or the SBA) or some form of equity investment
(e.g., venture capital or angel investors). But there are many other creative
ways to secure the start-up funds and working capital necessary to bring a new
business into financial viability. Working with complementary parties within
your new business's value chain (from materials suppliers and the facilities
owner to distribution networks and retail outlets), it is possible to secure
capital in nontraditional ways as well.

Securing a physical location for your business introduces you to the first
level in your value chain, the facilities owner. I've worked on many deals
over the years where the start-up business has subleased space from an
established business in the same or a related industry. For instance, a
manufacturing business might have 15,000 square feet in its headquarters. You
could come in and sublease one 200-square-foot front office and 750 square
feet of product storage space in a corner of the warehouse. The established
business then charges you a flat rate (generally much lower per square foot
than if you secured your own location), and things like the phones, fax
machines, PC network, copiers and voice mail are shared within certain preset
parameters. Perhaps the established business makes component parts for you or
supplies raw materials or customer referrals. Having a smaller and emerging
business around is like having another sales rep in the office to generate new
customer accounts, because every time you land a contract, the big company is
guaranteed a "supply sale" in the deal.

Next, you could negotiate with your distributor to speed up customer payments
by offering discounts. For example, your customers could agree to pay C.O.D.
in return for a 5 percent discount on their invoices (or a higher discount if
paid before the shipment is received). If you have a gross margin that can
accommodate such a deduction from the selling price, that would be a great
source of front-end working capital. In addition, your sublease may have a
three- to four-month grace period (I've seen as much as six months or a year)
before sub-rent is due. So if a few of your first sales invoices can be
collected early, you can generate some positive cash flow in the early days of
operations. Supplier-landlords are sometimes willing to extend 60 to 90 days
trade credit on the component parts, knowing that once start-ups get
established in their markets, exclusive parts providers' long-term profit
prospects are excellent.

If your start-up is subleasing from a larger business, you could also sign a
mutual-referral deal. Here's an example of such a deal: A small sheet-metal
company sets up subleased space inside the facilities of a larger heating and
air company. When the entrepreneur comes across a job too large for his or her
capabilities, he or she sends it directly to the larger business and receives
a finder's fee. The supplier gives the new company 90 days to pay for duct,
insulation and the like. The customers of smaller residential jobs agree to
pay 50 percent upfront and the other half when the job is finished, and they
receive an overall 10 percent discount on the entire installation. When the
larger company comes across a small residential job, it refers the work to the
smaller company and gets to sell more supplies. In time, the smaller company
could build a solid book of business and move out of the larger company's
facility, but maintain an exclusive-supplier and referral arrangement that's a
win-win for both companies.

There might be some nominal cash needed upfront (less than $5,000) for a
computer or some printed materials (brochures, letterhead, business cards)
that could be charged to a personal credit card. But I have even seen
entrepreneurs pick up all kinds of used equipment at less than half the retail
price, or get into "no money down" leases that secure top-end equipment with
little or no upfront capital investment.

Finding start-up capital comes down to being creative, having something of
value to offer potential partners and working hard to secure sales revenues
that can jump-start your new venture.
