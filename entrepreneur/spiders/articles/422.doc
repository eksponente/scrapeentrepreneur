On The Money

Cash crunches happen to every homebased entrepreneur. How to cope? "You can
tighten your belt without your hurting your customers, your professionalism or
your efficiency," promises Kimberly Stans�ll, author of _Bootstrapper's
Success Secrets: 151 Tactics for Building Your Business on a Shoestring
Budget_ (Career Press, $13.99, 800-CAREER-1). "[Because] homebased businesses
have a veil of privacy, they can get by without things that would be necessary
if the business were outside the home." Stans�ll's suggestions:

  * Take on additional work. Get a part-time job or use a hobby to generate quick cash." As long as you continue to service your regular clients, they won't know you're running two or three businesses from home," Stans�ll says.
  * Bring outsourced tasks in-house until the crisis passes. If you can't manage alone, convince your spouse, a parent or a friend to help. If you have children, give them tasks that can free you to concentrate on bringing in the bucks.
  * Cut phone costs. Little extras add up. Do you really need call forwarding and three-way calling?
