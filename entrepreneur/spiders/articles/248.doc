Taking Credit

Remember when the kids picked teams back in grade school, and all the captains
fought for the school's star athlete? Well, guess what? In the game of
business credit cards, it's you the big three are fighting for.

Though American Express, MasterCard and Visa once viewed small businesses as
risky bets, they're now aggressively courting you with low introductory rates
and perks like vendor discounts, reward programs and consulting services. In
fact, there's never been a better time to become a cardholder, says Robert
McKinley, CEO of Frederick, Maryland-based Ram Research Group Ltd., which
produces the bank card publication CardTrak. "The competition has geared up so
much in the business card area that you can benefit immensely from gathering
points and miles," he says. "So in addition to building a credit record for
the business and helping to separate personal and business expenses, business
owners can generate a lot of extra value."
