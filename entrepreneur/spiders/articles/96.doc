5 Ways to Know if Your Idea Could Become a Business

Gregg Brockway has launched major brands that address chronic problems in the
travel sector. But it was the pain of moving house that led the co-founder of
Hotwire and TripIt to tackle his latest venture. “We moved several times,”
Brockway says. “Each time we moved, we would have furniture that just didn’t
fit in our new house, and it was driving me crazy. My wife had spent a lot of
time finding those [pieces], picking out the colors, the fabrics, and then
we’d basically give it away or sell that thing on Craigslist or to a
consignment shop.”

So Brockway launched Chairish, an online consigment shop for quality vintage
furniture and home décor, along with his wife, Anna; former Hotwire partner
Eric Grosse; and former TripIt partner Andy Denmark. “It was an idea that we
had from personal experience [and] the pain around it,” Brockway says.

The idea paid off quickly. “On the very first day, we actually sold some of
that stuff without any marketing … and the smallest amount of traffic you can
imagine,” he says. “We were just, ‘Wow. We’re on to something.’”

The initial interest led the trio to believe that their curated marketplace
could fly, even though they’d done little in the way of market research.
“There are ways of looking at a business and seeing it’s working,” Brockway
says. “Typically, it’s further along in a business. Most investors, they want
to come onboard when you can show them that you make more money from your
customers than it costs you to find them. When your business gets to that
point, it is super easy. You’re off to the races. The hard part is, how do you
tell if you’re on to something before the numbers start rolling in?”

We asked some experienced entrepreneurs to give us their criteria for moving
ahead with a new business. Does your idea fit the bill?

## 1. Your idea solves a problem.

Truly disruptive ideas provide a balm for some kind of pain, solving a problem
or making life more convenient, efficient or affordable. “At the very earliest
stage, maybe you, the founder, are your only user,” says Jessica Livingston,
partner in Mountain View, Calif.-based early-stage accelerator Y Combinator,
which has funded more than 700 startups. “Maybe you’re building something to
solve your own problem.”

But chances are that if you’ve noticed a particular problem that needs
solving, others have, too. In 2013, Y Combinator funded a single-founder
company called Medisas. Gautam Sivakumar, a physician, wanted to address a
significant problem plaguing hospitals: the handoff of patients and their
critical medical information to new doctors during shift changes, which can
create confusion that leads to about 60,000 deaths annually.

“He started a startup to basically create software to facilitate this process
so that there weren’t any mistakes in handwriting, and nothing got lost on a
sticky note,” Livingston says.

Sometimes it takes tweaking to determine the real problem. When Lisa Falzone
and her business partner launched San Francisco-based Revel Systems, the
original plan was to sell an ordering app for restaurants. “We were in a
meeting with our first client trying to sell him the ordering app,” Falzone
says. “He was like, ‘That’s a great idea … but what I really need is a [point-
of-sale] system.’ And he went on and on about how much he hated dealing with
POS companies, and no one would call him back even for a sales call. I
actually told him in the meeting that we would build it for him. That’s how we
started it. We realized that the point of sale was a huge pain point.
Therefore, we saw a great opportunity to resolve it and make people’s lives
better.”

Revel Systems now sells iPad POS systems for movie theaters, stadiums,
retailers, groceries and restaurants, including Baja Fresh Mexican Grill and
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.

## 2. You’re in it for the long haul.

If you don’t think you can put in the time and energy to bring your idea to
fruition, don’t bother. Livingston sees this situation often at Y Combinator.
When a business isn’t growing fast enough for the founder’s liking, she says,
“they come to us and they say, ‘I’m just not passionate about the idea of
working in local coupons. It’s just not that interesting to me.’ I put my head
in my hands and think, _Then why did you start this?_

“Honestly,” she adds, “you are going to go through so many problems and have
so many people turning the screws on you and things going wrong throughout the
life of a startup that if you don’t have a genuine love and a passion—and I
hate the word _passion,_ but I have to use it in this case—if you don’t have a
passion for the idea, it’s most likely you’re going to give up.”

Jason Lucash, co-founder of Costa Mesa, Calif.-based OrigAudio, which racked
up $750,000 in sales in its first year, suggests giving your idea time to
percolate and running it past people you trust. “You want to sleep on it.
Maybe wait a week,” he says. “Show some of your friends and family, people you
really trust in your inner circle. Then if it’s still sitting pretty well with
you, go out and try to pursue it.”

## 3. People are anxious to get their hands on your product.

Other people need to be as excited about your idea as you are. “Do you have a
small number of users who love your product? That’s usually a good sign that
you’re on to something, and you can find ways to expand from there,”
Livingston says.

Start testing the idea and showing the prototype to friends, family members
and, as soon as possible, potential customers.

“I think you have to crank up the ‘Who cares?’ meter,” says Joan Schneider,
CEO of Boston-based PR and integrated marketing firm Schneider Associates,
which specializes in product launches. “How big is the market?”

As you start showing off your idea, listen for that elusive word: _love._
“It’s a really hard word to come by, but it’s super powerful,” Chairish’s
Brockway says.

But don’t be put off if it doesn’t get hurled at you from every person you
approach. This process is about finding people who will eventually want to buy
your product (and become your evangelists and/or guerrilla marketers). People
who get what you’re after will (with their dollars and feedback) help convince
investors that you’re worth backing.

Validation won’t always come from where you expect: Brockway says “a lot of
smart people” thought TripIt, which he co-founded in 2006 to organize
itineraries and make travel easier, was “a dumb idea, particularly some of the
more successful venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. They said, ‘Why do I
need someone to organize my travel? I’ve got a secretary for that.’ But we
kept getting all these e-mails from users who said, ‘I love this. This is so
great.’ It gave us the confidence to keep going in the face of these smart
people who just didn’t get it.”

That early testing phase can also help you understand potential selling points
to highlight when marketing your product. When Lucash and his partner Mike
Szymczak developed the prototype for the first OrigAudio product—sustainably
produced folding cardboard speakers—they realized they had tapped into the
consumer demand for eco-friendly, U.S.-made products, as well as the hot audio
market. “We showed it to like 10 of our friends and asked them if they would
use it,” Lucash says. “All of them were like, ‘This is awesome. I would
totally use it. I think there’s mass-market potential.’”

## 4. You’ve kept it simple and responded to feedback.

“A lot of people say, ‘I could really build a better Expedia if I could just
bring together air, car, hotel, destination, activities, customer reviews …’
Every one of those things is a big problem, and you can’t do everything well,
so you end up doing nothing well,” Brockway explains. “I think that’s a big
red flag if you just keep adding on features and functionality to your core
product to try and make it more attractive to people.”

By scaling back on the bells and whistles from the get-go, you can avoid a lot
of hassle, planning and spending. It’s a lesson Brockway and the TripIt team
learned the pricey way: “We had a grand plan for making TripIt this really
rich trip-planning application that brought together information from all
these different sources and allowed you to plan the perfect trip,” Brockway
says. “We put all this stuff together, and people weren’t using it. What they
wanted was just a simple, vanilla online folder concept that helped them
organize information.”

If, during testing, you find that users are focused on just one piece of your
idea, consider scrapping the parts they ignore. “Sometimes you also see
businesses where the overall metrics might actually be downright bad, but they
might have a little piece of the product or a customer segment that really
works, and by focusing in around that, it can have this scenic reemergence,”
Brockway says. “You’ve got limited resources and limited time, and a great
company can really only do one or two things well.”

Adds Livingston: “Keep it simple, launch quickly, get feedback from users out
there, because nothing is better than launching and understanding how people
are using your product.” For a role model, she says, look no further than
PayPal. “When they started, you could transfer cash through PDA devices. They
thought that they’d raise funding on that, and it’s just the way it was going
to be. Then they got calls from eBay users saying, ‘Hey, I noticed your web
version that you have as an example. We want that on eBay. We want to be able
to accept money.’ Finally the founders of PayPal were like, ‘Oh, my God. This
is how people are using it.’”

## 5. the timing is right.

Is the market ready for you? “A lot of times ideas have been tried before, but
unsuccessfully. Then they’re resurrected, and they work this time around,”
Brockway says. If a past idea is nipping at your brain, figure out how the
world is different today than when the idea fizzled the first time.

Influences might include emerging or widely adapted technology (Chairish
sellers benefit from being able to snap and upload photos with ease from their
smartphones) and new or updated legislation (such as liquor laws, healthcare
mandates and the legalization of recreational marijuana).

Think of Airbnb, whose founders interviewed with Y Combinator in 2008. At the
time, Livingston and her team thought, _Huh, what a weird idea, staying on
someone’s airbed._ Would the crowdsourced, couch-surfing sensation have worked
as well years earlier, before online ratings, ubiquitous photo posting and the
social acceptability of meeting strangers on the internet? Probably not.

As the CEO of a startup, you can’t control whether you come up with an idea
before its time. But you can look at trends and shifts that may signal the
time is right to take your idea beyond the light-bulb stage.
