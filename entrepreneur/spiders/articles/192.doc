Itsy-Bitsy Bonds

When Ned Golterman first thought about what options were available for
financing the expansion of Golterman & Sabo, his St. Louis-based building
materials company, the solution seemed simple. He could use his local bank,
just as he had in the past. But when one of his advisors suggested that an
alternative low-interest loan from the Industrial Development Authority might
better serve the company, Golterman decided to learn more.

"I had heard about these types of loans, but the reputation was they were
great for companies like Chrysler but weren't [an option] for entrepreneurial
manufacturers like my company," says Golterman, 43. After he made a visit to
the St. Louis County Economic Authority, however, Golterman became a believer
in the idea. What changed his mind? A new program he discovered, known as
"mini-bonds," which saved him thousands of dollars in interest, while cutting
through the red tape associated with bonds.
