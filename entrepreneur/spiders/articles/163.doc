A 'Kool' Nerd's Lessons on Launching a Killer Social Enterprise

The term “social entrepreneur” has become more and more common since the
advent of companies such as Tom’s Shoes and One Hope Wines.

The exciting part about the evolution of social enterprise is that companies
everywhere are building businesses with philanthropy and important societal
elements at their core -- but let’s be clear, many of these aren’t non-profit
businesses. In fact, many are building quite profitable companies while giving
back at applause-worthy levels.

In case you’re not completely familiar with the term “social entrepreneur” or
enterprise, let’s go to our friend [Wikipedia
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship)for a simple but
informative comparison: “Business entrepreneurs typically measure performance
in profit and return, but social entrepreneurs also take into account a
positive return to society."

Pretty straightforward, right?

So how does one develop a social enterprise that acts like a full-fledged
business but has the capacity to change the world through giving back? Well, I
don’t know because I’ve never built a social enterprise. So I connected with
Orane Barrett, founder of a New York-based inspirational clothing brand that
is changing the meaning of a word that has a historically negative connotation
-- nerd.

## Start with your passion.

Barrett came to the U.S. from Jamaica as an 8 year old and grew up in the
inner city of New York. In his formative years, Barrett was fortunate to have
a few great mentors that helped him to see education as a path to achieve
success. He wanted to be a doctor but wasn’t really sure why -- aside from the
fact that his mother was a nurse -- so he went to the University of Rochester
to pursue medicine but ended up in chemical engineering.

He was always good at chemistry and math, but when told about the chemical
engineering program, he responded, “I don’t want to be an electrician.” It is
this very misunderstanding that is at the core of his budding social
enterprises -- to expose inner city kids to the wealth of possible career
paths and opportunities.

After completing an MBA at MIT, Barrett found himself unsatisfied as an
investment banker at a large New York firm. He knew a change was necessary
that would allow him to provide needed exposure that most young people in his
community lacked -- they didn’t know their options. So he started [Kool Nerd
Clothing](http://www.koolnerdclothing.com/), a brand he says “promotes the
positive values of today’s nerd: hard work, intelligence, individuality and
passion.”

## See where the market is going.

Do you have a space that you’re passionate about and are eager to give back?
Well, we know that one can’t just set up shop and expect to move a product or
service. Instead, you must be as strategic in a social enterprise as in a
business enterprise, if not more.

Barrett says that he "saw that the intelligence movement was taking place and
that represented opportunity.”

Kool Nerd Clothing was born and "started with one logo on one product and the
response was positive.” This gave him the chance to “use t-shirts as a
positive marketing tool to communicate the positive values of today's nerd and
inspire future kool nerds to join the movement.”

Kool Nerd’s social "give back" comes in the form of its 4.0 program, which is
built around donating $4 from every product sold toward working with inner
city children, or more specifically, partnerships with STEAM programs --
that’s science, technology, engineering, arts and math -- simultaneously
aiding with job demand for hyper-specialized fields.

## **Keep it lean and create exposure.**

Barrett started part time until Kool Nerd was moving along and was in need of
his full time and attention. At that point, he left his job and teamed with
visual arts painter and graphic designer Kwami Delfish to help build the
brand.

Delfish says he was attracted to the idea because “Kool Nerd wanted to be the
brand that goes out into the community and encourages students to see the term
'nerd' in a positive light”.

Like most well run small businesses, it started and remained lean through the
early days, spending modestly and working to grow its footprint with
grassroots efforts. To garner exposure and affirm the business model --
essentially prove that someone was willing to pay for the product -- Kool Nerd
launched a [crowdfunding campaign through
Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/356572152/kool-nerd-
clothing). This wasn’t done to raise money, although that’s a nice unintended
consequence, but instead to increase awareness and get the message out --
which can prove to be an amazing business tool when executed well.

In the case of Kool Nerd Clothing, the desire to create a socially-conscious
movement was married with the business-like efficiency that is required and
sure to generate incredible outcomes, all while helping those that will no
doubt dictate and control our futures -- the kids.
