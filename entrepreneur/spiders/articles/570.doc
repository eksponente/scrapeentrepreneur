Entrepreneurs Fight the Consumer Credit Crunch

For decades, credit cards have provided (for good or bad) a source of working
capital for households and entrepreneurs. Those easy to obtain credit line
increases proved a lifeline for small businesses and were much easier than
dealing with a bank, if a bank approved the loan at all. When the credit
market crisis began in 2007, the behavior of the card companies began to
change, and with those changes small business began to feel the pinch.  
  
The problem is access to credit. Angel investors and venture capitalists used
to provide small, innovative businesses with capital to expand before going
public. But that market has slowed recently, with venture capitalists wary for
two reasons: there are a limited number of new ideas in which to invest and
even if an idea has promise and works, where will the additional financing
come from when the VC investors are ready to cash out?  
  
The credit market crisis is now two years old and showing signs of easing. The
stock market also shows some positive momentum, but these early signs of
market improvement only apply to the largest, most credit worthy businesses.
Small business owners and entrepreneurs still suffer under-funding as the
markets strain under the past indulgences of the easy money boom.  
  
A resurgent secondary stock market does not necessarily mean that IPOs will be
successful even if they make it to the starting gate. Banks have tightened
their grip on small businesses, with no real end in sight. Under these
conditions, investing money in the next new thing is risky and may have to
wait for another day.  
  
We're not talking the next software or information technology companies here,
but rather the average local business--the retail store, service provider, or
small manufacturer. Over the years their second line of financing was a loan
from a bank or the Small Business Administration. But their first round of
financing came from an equally familiar place--the entrepreneur's personal
credit card. No card company ever asked what those sundry charges were for as
long as they were paid for on time--until now.  
  
Credit card terms were mostly favorable for entrepreneurs with one exception--
the interest rates. Minimum payments, constantly increasing lines of credit
and the side benefits of reward points took some of the sting out of the high
rates of interest. That is, until the credit crisis prompted the card
companies to increase their interest charges and tighten up their billing
practices.  
  
The loudest complaints about the new wave of credit card company practices
centered on the arbitrary raising of interest for no apparent reason. The
Federal Reserve, aware of the practice, tried to stem things last December by
announcing that the card companies couldn't raise rates without giving card
holders adequate notice. The Fed later backpedalled, stating that the new
guidelines would not go into effect until July 2010, time enough for all card
companies to act in their own best interests.  
  
Even the new Credit Card Act does not obviate these practices. Cardholders
have seen their rates rise, credit lines scaled back and major penalties added
for minor infractions such as a rare late payment.  
  
At the same time, no public discussion about the ridiculous interest rates
card companies charge consumers has been heard. The only discussion is about
the timing of the rate hikes, not the levels to which they are rising.  
  
When the old state usury laws were dismantled one-by-one during the 1980s,
consumer interest was free to rise without restriction. The Fed's authority
didn't extend to the levels of interest charged, only whether the rate was
stated clearly following the Truth in Lending Act.  
  
It will be some time before anyone knows the effect of these card company
practices on small businesses. It is not quite analogous to say that
entrepreneurs with a bright idea are just ordinary card holders who suffer
like anyone else. The role the personal credit card has played in the early
financing of small businesses is being neglected. In the early millennial
boom, it was assumed that many were using that extra credit provided to
purchase frivolous items. No one gave much thought to the entrepreneur who was
desperately trying to get a venture off the ground.  
  
More stringent credit card reform is needed to protect consumers against
predatory practices by the card companies. Those controls won't just help the
typical consumer, they would also make the small business owner smile again.
Then the angel investors and the venture capitalists will be flying high again
in the not-too-distant future.
