Why Lenders Like Funding Business Acquisitions

Three words sum up Karin Mills' business philosophy: refurbish, recycle,
reuse. "If I can spruce up a room or equipment, I've saved thousands for
something else," says the Carrboro, North Carolina, restaurateur. "I don't
know what I'd do if I had a slab of land and had to decide what kind of
building to put there. But it would probably be square." That's because Mills
and business partner Linda Bourne, 39, have encountered some unusual
structures. When launching their first venture in 1998, [Spotted Dog
Restaurant & Bar](http://www.spotteddogrestaurant.com/), they had to contend
with a V-shaped building with narrow walkways. Then they set their sights on a
restaurant in a train car, which they adapted into an old-fashioned soda shop.

Both times, they made the most of unique opportunities absent major commercial
funding. Growth was swift, particularly after adding catering to the business
mix, but their facilities were ill-equipped to handle the increased output.
"We were making ice cream, and we were in a train car," recalls Mills, 37.

Then came their big break: a thriving dessert cafe for sale in an eclectic
Durham, North Carolina, neighborhood. Not only would it provide more
elbowroom, but it was also an opportunity to expand their ice cream business.
The cafe had its own line of Italian-style ice cream and sorbets, to which
Mills and Bourne could add their "soy creams." With the extra space and
equipment, they would be able to supply area stores and eateries.

For this transaction, the women needed more than a little help from family and
friends, the main source of outside funding for their business collaboration
up to that point. And despite their early successes, they had to work hard to
get a bank onboard for such a major expansion. That they were buying an
operating business with an established clientele undoubtedly helped, but
bankers needed assurance. "We fielded questions about whether we were biting
off more than we could chew," Mills recollects. "We knew it sounded ridiculous
that adding another business would make it easier, but in the long run, we
knew it would meet all these other needs." A local bank eventually agreed to
provide funding for the acquisition in early 2003. Had the women wanted to
build their own facility, though, the outcome may have been much different.
"We probably wouldn't have gotten the loan," Mills admits. "But if I go back
in a year, either to buy a business or to expand, they would look at me in a
different light."

The truth is, Mills' credit prospects are probably better if she continues to
buy rather than build. Lenders tend to view buyouts more favorably, because
the acquired business has a credit history, existing assets and a customer
base, while organic growth may take the entrepreneur into untested territory.
Another advantage is the potential for seller financing, which often provides
more favorable terms than otherwise available.

Although buying clearly has benefits- access to cash flow and existing
operational infrastructure among them- often is a downside. Entrepreneurs
frequently have to absorb employees and costly overhead, which can zap
operating funds. Moreover, acquirers may have trouble getting traditional
financing if creditors, who tend to appraise assets based on liquidation
value, not replacement cost, believe the deal is inflated.

Before financing any growth, creditors want to know that the borrower has a
bona fide growth opportunity and the requisite skills to capitalize on it. "If
there is that mix, it says to the lender that all that's keeping [the
entrepreneur] from being really successful is the lack of money," observes
Mary Speight, an assistant regional director at the [North Carolina Small
Business and Technology Development Center](http://www.sbtdc.org/)in Durham,
North Carolina. "That's the clincher for most bankers."

Given the choice between internal expansion and a business purchase, however,
lenders generally view the latter as inherently less risky. "I would say
there's less risk in buying something that's viable with customers because
[the entrepreneur] is absorbing someone else's customers, and there isn't a
new competitor," says Emilia DiMenco, executive vice president of [Harris
Trust & Savings Bank](http://www.harrisbank.com/)in Chicago. DiMenco, however,
is cautious when the purchase represents more than 25 percent of the buyer's
overall operation. In large deals, the financial strength of the borrower is
often a deciding factor. "A strong acquirer," she maintains, "can sustain
greater operating and financial risk than a weak acquirer."

Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, often consider buyouts a cheaper alternative
to investing in infrastructure of their own. That isn't necessarily the case,
experts warn. "They may need to bring on additional assets," stresses Richard
Cheney, associate state director of operations for the [Connecticut Small
Business Development Center](http://www.business.uconn.edu/csbdc)in Storrs,
Connecticut. "They'll need an increase in permanent working capital." In fact,
underestimating capital expenditures is one of the most common mistakes
acquirers make. "The equipment might be fully depreciated, meaning that it's
likely in the first few years they'll have to replace it," Cheney adds.

Mills experienced tighter cash flow after her recent purchase. "We weren't
able to continue doing a few of the things the previous owner had done, like
advertising," she says. Additionally, some planned upgrades, such as
installing a new dishwasher, had to be accelerated after a health inspection.
The sacrifices were worth it for the new owners, whose combined businesses now
generate about $1 million in annual sales. "I do baking here for our other
restaurants, and we do wedding cakes here for the catering business," says
Mills. "It was really the plug we needed to give us enough space."

Before you buy a business, experts recommend you thoroughly analyze the
company you're considering. Comparing it to industry peers will reveal how the
company is performing beyond the seller's hype. If the assessment uncovers
middling performance, you could use it to negotiate a lower price or to make
the case for seller financing. Not only do sellers typically offer more
lenient terms and a less rigorous credit review, but they often take only the
business's assets as collateral, while conventional lenders may also require
personal holdings.

Determining a company's worth isn't an exact science, so negotiations with
traditional creditors may break down over purchase price. Conflict over the
value of intangible assets like a business's location or client base can
jeopardize financing. "The lender often says, 'There's no collateral behind
[the intangible assets],'" says Cheney. "If you don't have enough collateral
from the assets of the buyer, seller financing is often required." Most seller
financing is only for about five years, but it may be amortized over a longer
period, with a portion of the principal remaining at the end of the loan term;
the buyer has to get outside financing to pay off the balance in a "balloon"
payment. The initial payout, before an outside creditor is involved, can be
steep. "There's more cash going out," says Cheney, "but they're paying less
interest."
