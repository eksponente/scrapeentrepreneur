7 Tips for Getting the Information You Need Before Becoming a Franchisee

So, you’ve done your research online and have a sense of the franchise that
most interests you. You are drawn to what the business does, and you’ve had
great conversations with the franchisor about how all the pieces of the
business work together -- operations, marketing, technology, real estate (if
applicable) and overall brand management. You are chomping at the bit to ask
franchisees what it’s really like to be an owner, and learn if the lifestyle
and income potential match your entrepreneurial dream.

You're on the right track: Speaking with current franchisees to validate
everything you’ve learned about the franchise is the crux of your
investigation. Your franchise representative will give you a clear signal when
to reach out to franchisees.

Here are seven keys to successfully gathering the facts and figures you desire
from validation:

## 1\. Speak with a five or more franchisees.

[As a franchise coach](http://franlocators.com/about/meet-anna/), I encourage
franchise candidates to speak with a _minimum_ of five current owners. If you
are checking out multiple franchises at the same time, it’s a good idea to
narrow your options to the two top contenders before validation. This will
save you time and effort and make the deep dive into the details more
manageable.

## **2\. Respect the discovery process.**

Doesn’t it make sense to first understand the basics about the franchise, so
that you know what the franchisees are talking about, and you can ask
insightful questions? What a missed opportunity to have franchisees explain to
you how it all works, when you could be asking them questions the franchisor
can’t answer such as, “Did you find the training to be comprehensive, and did
it allow you to be successful in an industry new to you?” You’ve heard about
the training from the franchise development representative. Now you can hear
what franchisees think about it, the support provided and all the other
important aspects of the franchise.

## 3\. Prepare your questions.

A good franchise consultant helps you create a list of questions. A short list
of 10-to-12 meaningful questions will aid you in validating the franchise’s
training and support mechanisms, its operational processes and the viability
of the business model and marketing strategy. Asking just this one question
will shed lots of light on the opportunity: “What’s a day in the life of a
franchisee like?”

## **4\. Respect the fact that "time is money."**

Since franchisees are _volunteering_ to speak with you, be respectful of their
time by being informed and well prepared. It may be helpful to email your
questions in advance of a scheduled phone appointment. Some franchises have
regularly scheduled group validation conference calls, with a franchisee who
volunteers to host the call. This makes validation efficient for everyone.

## 5\. Look for trends.

Avoid allowing the comments of one franchisee to outweigh valuable input from
others. When you come across someone whose opinion is an outlier, whether
positive or negative, ask questions to see if this individual is executing on
what he or she was trained to do, and closely following the systems that
minimize cost and drive revenue. Find out why this person's results are not
the norm. This will aid you in determining if there are issues you should
investigate, either on the side of the franchisor or that of the franchisee.

## 6\. Know your numbers.

Franchisees are individuals with different skills, goals and motivations.
Although everyone took the same training, expect variation on the part of
franchisees when it comes to execution and to their financial results. Learn
what key performance indicators they use to monitor their businesses. Spend
time understanding what drives revenue and how long it takes to break even.
Obviously, you want to learn what the income potential is as well as
understand costs and operating expenses. After gathering financial information
from a variety of franchisees, analyze it, then make your own projections
based on what you want to achieve with your business.

## 7\. Build bridges.

If you are awarded a franchise, the people you connect with during validation
will be your peers. They can be a wonderful resource to you and may play a
valuable role in your success. Thank each franchisee for his or her time and
wrap up all your validation calls in a timely manner so you can head into the
final phase of the discovery process -- attending a Discovery Day or a Meet
the Team Day, as these events are sometimes called.

The quality of the facts and figures you gather during validation will play a
vital role in helping you determine if a specific franchise is right for you.
Following these seven tips will assist you in getting the best information
possible when making that decision.
