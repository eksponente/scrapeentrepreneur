KISS Co-Founder: To Be a Success in Business, Think 'Me' First

In his latest book, _ME, INC: Build an Army of One, Unleash Your Inner Rock
God, Win in Life and Business (_HarperCollins, 2014)_, Gene Simmons, co-
founder of the multi-platinum rock band KISS, shares how to build a business
strategy, harness the countless tools available in the digital age, network
and be the architect of an entity. _

_In this edited excerpt, Simmons shares the importance of your personality and
skills when starting a business._

The journey that you must make to become a real estate mogul and have your
name become a brand, like Lefrak or Trump, is not the same road that a comic-
book geek has to travel to launch a comic-book company (like my Simmons
Comics) and get production companies to develop his comic-book creations into
TV shows and films.

So what does all of this mean? It means _you_ will have to figure it out for
yourself.

_That’s _what _entrepreneur _really means.

You make up your own rules. And you have to educate yourself and learn
whatever you need to learn to have the tools to go out there and be the
business warrior and champion that’s inside you, yearning to get out.

They don’t teach that stuff in school.

The reason this book is called _ME, Inc. _is that I am the most important
person in my private and business life.

That’s right, me first. Maybe it’s not politically correct, but it’s
necessary, if you want to increase your chances of success big time.

Take a hint from the airline industry. If there is turbulence on your flight,
the crew will tell you to take the life-sustaining oxygen mask that just fell
in front of you and put it on your face first -- not your child’s face. On the
surface, it sounds cruel, but it makes pragmatic sense, because if you can’t
help yourself first, you will not be able to help anyone else. Not your child,
not your family, not your friends, not anyone.

To some extent, capitalism in America has its hands tied behind its back. But
there is still enough of a capitalist business world out there that will give
you a chance of making Big Money.

In point of fact, you cannot fail. Yes, you heard me right. _You cannot fail._

You have everything to gain, and little or nothing to lose, by throwing
yourself head-first into your entrepreneurial endeavor. If your business fails
and you cannot pay off your debts, under current business laws you can declare
Chapter 7 or Chapter 11, which means that with a decent lawyer, you will be
forgiven of all your debts and you can start all over again. Of course,
because you’re an ethical person, as soon as you hit the big time, you will
pay off your debts anyway, even though you may not be legally required to do
so.

The only thing holding you back from succeeding in America may be you.

Before you undertake this journey, you must have the heart of a lion and your
self-esteem must be intact. If your self-esteem isn’t strong, then bluff and
act like it’s strong. Grit your teeth and pretend that you have enormous self-
confidence. Fake it until you make it.
