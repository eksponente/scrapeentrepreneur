Hot Tech Startups Get as Many Perks as They Give

Startups are known for their lavish and often ridiculous perks, from
acupuncture to personal chefs, “[rock rooms](http://online.wsj.com/news/articl

pits, even assistants who [wait for the cable guy on your

[held weekly raffles](http://mashable.com/2012/05/28/startup-perks-culture/)
to give employees $500 in cash. Evernote, the productivity software startup in
Redwood City, Calif., [pays
employees](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/business/phil-libin-of-evernote-
on-its-unusual-corporate-culture.html) $1,000 to use their allotted vacation
days as intended.

It’s all in the name of employee recruitment—and, once they’re hired, employee
retention. Startups know that they compete for talent with the big, public
technology companies that can offer even sweeter benefits packages, including
liquid stock options. This week, Apple and Facebook announced that they would
pay for female employees to freeze their eggs.

But startup companies are also the beneficiaries of perks, often in the form
of discounts from service providers, larger technology companies—even other
startups. HubSpot, a marketing software company in Cambridge, Mass., [offers
90% off](http://www.hubspot.com/jumpstart) its very expensive software for one
year to early-stage startups with less than $1 million in funding and revenue.
Participants in the 500 Startups accelerator have access to 250 different
perks, including a year of free email distribution from SendGrid, a free
business credit report consultation from Dun and Bradstreet, and cheaper
snacks for the office.

Unlike regular businesses, startups are geared for hyper-growth. A tiny client
without money to spend on services can quickly turn into a massive one that is
flush with cash. (Consider Uber, which reportedly brought in $1 billion in car
service bookings after just three years in business.)

Beyond snagging high-growth clients, the service providers are betting that if
startups use their services, they will trickle up to larger companies. “It’s
about being able to say, ‘We’re a company that serves startups,’” says Elli
Sharef, co-founder and HireArt, a recruiting services platform. “They have
cachet, as in, whatever the newest startups are using, it must be good.”

[HireArt](https://www.hireart.com/), itself a startup, has benefitted from
many perks, including credits for cloud hosting from Amazon Web Services,
$50,000 of free cloud services time through Heroku, and a steep discount from
the law firm Wilmer Hale effective until the company raises a Series A round
of funding.

Now, HireArt is offering its own perks to startups. The company’s recruitment
platform costs $995 per month per position or more, which is too pricey for a
seed-stage startup. “Most five-person startups are scrambling to recruit with
D.I.Y. solutions like posting on AngelList and CraigsList,” she says. But many
of HireArt’s job candidates want to work at early stage startups, so Sharef
decided to [offer free services](https://www.hireart.com/seed) to startups
with less than $2 million in funding that have graduated from a startup
accelerator. (The accelerators serve as a vetting mechanism.)

It’s amusing to see one venture-backed startup giving its services away to
other venture-backed startups, but that’s part of what makes a startup
ecosystem tick. Sharef notes HireArt couldn’t afford such an up-front
marketing expense if it weren’t backed by $2.4 million in venture funding.

“It’s like this big pile of VC money moves from one company to another,” she
says. Since launching in 2012, HireArt has accumulated about 500 clients, most
of which are venture-funded. Around 15% have 100 to 200 employees. With any
luck (and maybe recruitment fees), some of those clients will turn into 500-
to 1,000-person companies and some of its new seed-stage clients will turn
into large, venture-backed, paying clients. And if not? Then the whole startup
ecosystem might find itself in trouble.
