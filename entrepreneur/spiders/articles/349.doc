(W)inner City

The battle for businesses seeking funding to brave the inner city may still be
uphill, but it's not as steep a climb as it once was. Encouraged by the
revitalization of once-stagnant neighborhoods such as New York City's Harlem,
more small businesses have been seeking and getting buy-in.

Oliver Wesson is president and CEO of The Retail Initiative Inc. in New York
City, a nonprofit real estate investment vehicle that helps inner-city
retailers get high-quality facilities. Wesson helped finance some of the first
chain stores that ultimately became anchors for dozens of small businesses now
lining Harlem's busy streets-and he remembers when businesses wouldn't dare
set up shop there. "It's easier today," he says of getting funding for inner-
city projects. "We've got some success stories now. Banks are more interested
in lending than they were 10 years ago."

Still, capital available for inner-city businesses, particularly minority-
owned ones, isn't nearly where it should be. C. Earl Peek, managing partner of
Diamond Ventures, an Atlanta-based VC firm investing in city businesses, cites
a Milken Institute study reporting that only 1 to 2 percent of venture capital
raised in 1999 went to minorities and minority-managed funds. "That's just a
total lack of capital for the inner city," Peek says.

It's a problem that the New Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) program seeks to
address with the promise of $150 million-plus an additional $30 million for
technical assistance-to qualifying firms, mostly inner-city. Inner-city
champions have also had their spirits buoyed by the New Markets Tax Credit,
which will make available $15 billion in credits to private investors in
community development.

President Bush's support stopped short of budgeting additional funding, so the
NMVC program may be short-lived, unless Congress appropriates more cash. But
Kerwin Tesdell, president of the Community Development Venture Capital
Alliance, a New York City-based advocacy group managing funds with more than
$300 million collectively, believes inner-city businesses won't be hurting for
investors. "This industry already existed and is fully funded with private-
sector capital," he says. "The government came along and saw a good thing and
said 'We'd like to add some support here,' but it's very much a private-sector
initiative."

The Retail Initiative is building a $50 million fund to bring supermarket and
drug store anchors into major cities. What they need are a few good
entrepreneurs. "That's the missing ingredient," Wesson says. "We've got a lot
of community-based organizations that are good nonprofits in terms of
mobilizing the community-but they don't have the entrepreneurial spirit."

The numbers suggest there's plenty of room for entrepreneurs in most inner
cities. New York's inner-city grocery stores, for example, outperform the
regional average by 39 percent, according to the Initiative for a Competitive
Inner City (ICIC) of Boston, which further estimates 25 percent of inner-city
demand is unmet. "Putting aside the downturn, which is affecting the economy
as a whole, the fundamental economics of cities have strengthened
significantly, and continue to," says Tesdell. "Businesses in inner cities
have a competitive advantage with location, particularly if they serve the
broader metropolitan area." The tremendous purchasing power alone, he adds, is
enough to drive businesses to the city.

That's exactly what Eric Bobby, 35, founder and CEO of CityKi, is betting on.
His Boston-based company designs touch-screen Internet kiosks for inner-city
retail storefronts. The drooping economy hasn't been easy on CityKi-some
investors pulled out early in response to the dotcom crash. But Bobby expects
VC funding soon and adds that investors focused on the inner-city market tend
to have a longer time frame for expected returns-and those returns can be more
personally rewarding. "You can have a bigger impact on people's lives in the
inner cities," Bobby says.

The social responsibility aspect isn't lost on investors, says Tesdell.
"There's both a financial bottom line and a social bottom line, and our
investors are interested in that double line," he says.

Whatever the motivation, inner-city businesses are gaining more attention as
lucrative investment vehicles, says Willie Woods, managing director of ICV
Partners LLC, a private equity fund focused on inner-city and minority-owned
growth companies, created by ICIC and American Securities Capital Partners.
ICV Partners is currently scouting out investments for the $130 million fund,
which closed in March. Ultimately, says Woods, the fund's performance will
speak for itself. "If you're running a business," he says, "and it's got year-
over-year growth of 20 percent, a niche market and a diversified customer
base, you'd say that's a nice business."
