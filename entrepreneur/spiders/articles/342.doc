Earn Your Way Out of Investments

The "harvest" strategy for any emerging-growth venture is always a major
sticking point when putting together a financing deal. Funding providers want
to have some reasonable assurances that the venture can eventually turn
positive cash flow into an investment return on the original capital. When the
business begins to spill profitability over the dam (meaning the vast majority
of the essential growth plans have been funded and revenues are strong and
reliable), many firms think an IPO is the next logical step in the life of the
firm.

But proportionately nationwide, the number of firms that actually execute a
successful IPO vs. the total number of companies doing business is
infinitesimal. So when an entrepreneur states that his or her firm is planning
to go public, investors recognize this is easier said than done. The most
likely exit strategy for an emerging enterprise is either an acquisition for
cash and/or stock by a larger firm in the same or related space in the market,
or a stock buy-back. And the most popular form of a stock buy-back is called
an earn-out.

A typical earn-out involves a 36- or 48-month window during which the firm has
strong sales, predictable operating costs and a fairly reliable stream of pre-
tax cash flow called EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization). The entrepreneur needs to calculate an acceptable level of
internal rate of return (IRR) on the investors' capital over the time frame
that includes the ramp-up to the beginning of the earn-out and the time period
until the earn-out is completed.

For example, let's say that original equity investors have been "in" the
venture for 50 months since launch. The firm is now in a solid position with
respect to EBITDA, and essentially all the major growth projects have been
funded, so the firm is competitively well-positioned for the next several
years. If the firm envisions a 36-month period over which to buy back all or a
large portion of the common stock from the original investors, the entire 86
months (50 + 36) are included in the IRR determination. The original invested
capital is treated as the baseline present-value cash outflow in the model.
The 50 monthly periods of zero cash inflow (the time up to the beginning of
the earn-out) are then followed by 36 months of fixed cash payments made to
the shareholders, during which predetermined numbers of shares are
systematically transferred from the original investors to the company. (This
could also be structured on a quarterly basis with 17 quarters of zero inflows
to investors, followed by 12 quarters of fixed installments paid out.) The
firm is going to "earn its way out" of the original investment by providing
returns back to investors from internally generated cash flows.

The trick in getting this earn-out to provide an attractive IRR over the life
of the entire investment horizon (the combined initial launch and ramp-up
periods--the 50 months in the example--plus the earn-out distribution stage).
A fixed quarterly or monthly cash outflow from the firm (cash inflow to
investors) would be determined for the 36 months. This payment has to be large
enough to support the targeted IRR that will provide incentive for the
investors to agree to the offer, yet it also has to fit comfortably into the
firm's operating margins between projected revenues and cost structure. This
systematic buy-back of stock provides liquidity for investors without an IPO,
yet allows the firm to do it in stages that preserve the integrity of the
operating margins and ongoing competitiveness of the firm.

Like any other deal, this will have to be negotiated through several rounds of
give-and-take. But eventually, the earn-out can provide a very reasonable
mechanism by which early-stage capital providers can realize liquidity on all
or a portion of their investment, and the company (and the entrepreneur) can
realize a recapture of a sizable amount of equity ownership through the
transfer of shares over the earn-out period.
