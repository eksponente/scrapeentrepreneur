Minority Loan and Grant Programs

**Q:** I would very much like to go out on my own, and I've created a business plan for an exciting business. However, because I'm in the "pre-funding" stage, I'm still plugging away at my day job. Are there any minority [small business loans](http://www.entrepreneur.com/bestbanks) or grantsÂ that could help me make the transition to entrepreneur?

**A:** There's a need for minority programs that assist in the maturation of new businesses, and there are several of these programs available. However, any entrepreneur seeking out these sources must also focus on how well her business survives independent of these programs--after all, a successful minority business will have to mature itself out of the program eventually. Make sure you have some sort of maturation plan in place that allows you to succeed without minority set-asides within three to five years, for instance; otherwise, you may find yourself simply building a business to be bought out or putting yourself at too great a risk.

Your first strategy is to look in your own area for local funding, which is
available in some communities from redevelopment agencies and other local
organizations. An example of a regional organization is [FAME
Renaissance](http://www.famerenaissance.com/), which operates several social
and business development programs designed to create wealth in impoverished
areas within Los Angeles County. Also in the Southern California area is
[Operation HOPE](http://www.operationhope.org/), a very worthwhile
organization that has dispersed a total of $72 million in minority loans to
homeowners and business owners. Even if you don't live in Southern California,
I'd recommend paying a visit to the Operation HOPE Web site, which has several
inspiring success stories as well as transcripts of speeches from Operation
HOPE founder John Bryant, who speaks eloquently about the issues revolving
around the "digital divide" and economic empowerment. Some other regional
organizations include Brotherhood Business Development & Capital Fund and
Pacific Coast Regional.

On a broader scale, Ron Langston, Assistant Secretary of Commerce under the
Bush administration, has been very dedicated to the growth of minority
businesses and appreciates the special needs that a minority may face in
making the transition to entrepreneur. Toward that end, have a look at the
upcoming [Minority Enterprise Development
Conference](http://www.medweek.gov/)and the Web site for the [Minority
Business Development Agency (MBDA)](http://www.mbda.gov/). Besides information
on funding, the MBDA site offers a wealth of good advice for any small
business, minority or otherwise.

Besides loans to get started, there are also minority set-asides that an
ongoing business can take advantage of. The [National Minority Supply and
Diversity Council (NMSDC)](http://www.nmsdc.org/)provides a direct link
between corporations and minority businesses. A quick look through its list of
member corporations--those companies that want to purchase quality goods and
services from minorities on a competitive basis--reveals some of the biggest
corporate citizens in the United States. The NMSDC, with regional offices in
most states, is a good first step in seeking out your first contracts once
you've launched your new business. You can even join its database of certified
minority suppliers and get referrals to corporate buyers. In 2000, member
corporations made purchases from minority businesses registered with the NMSDC
exceeding $54.3 billion.

Lastly, as with any type of financing, minority funding also depends on having
a sound business plan, quality goods and your personal dedication to success.
